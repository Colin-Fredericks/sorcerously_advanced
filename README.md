# Sorcerously Advanced

Official repo for the tabletop roleplaying game.

The game's official support site is http://suffadv.wikidot.com/

The output files for this book are created by zipping the Sorcerously_Advanced_epub folder and running it through [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to create the epub and mobi files you can see in the repo.

Please note that some e-readers do not handle CSS very well. I've tried to keep the use of CSS3 features to a minimum, but some devices may have glitches. If they interfere with your ability to read the book, please [file an Issue](https://github.com/Colin-Fredericks/sorcerously_advanced/issues) and I'll work with you to resolve them.
