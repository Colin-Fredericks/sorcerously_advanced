    <h1 id="living_magic">Living With Magic</h1>

    <p>
      This chapter contains essays about what it's like to live with magic in
      the Basin, how people deal with it on a day-to-day basis, and what
      Natures really "mean".
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the Advice chapter in Sorc, this chapter is written as me, the game
      designer, talking directly with you, the reader.
    </p>

    <h2 id="what_nature_is">
      What Nature Is
    </h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes in Sorc I refer to Nature scores by their numerical value for
      convenience, but the best phrase I've found is really "deep in the
      X-Nature." Nature is built via inclination and training, but neither of
      those things are what it really <em>represents</em>. Nature is about
      connection with fundamental aspects of being sentient.
    </p>

    <p>You have Nature because that's <em>who you are.</em></p>

    <p>
      More accurately, you have <em>potential</em> Nature because of who you
      are. Properly expressing your Nature requires tools and training, which
      is why spells are often referred to as Expressions. They are those
      tools. Someone who is very combative and aggressive but knows no actual
      spells of War will have a very low effective War score, and would get
      trounced by someone with a better ability to express their Nature. For
      ease of game play we don't track potential Nature scores - we only track
      <em>effective</em> scores, the ones that determine what you can actually
      use. I'll talk more about this below.
    </p>

    <p>
      When one person has two different Traditions, their Nature scores can
      vary for two reasons. First, they might not always have the skills
      necessary to express all that they are. Second, Traditions represent not
      only metaphysical paths and sources of power, but also mindsets and
      habits of thought. Some people, when they change Traditions, take on
      such a different mentality that their Nature scores must change to
      represent that. For example, ghosts from the Cult use The Practice for
      their day-to-day life or work, and The Rage when they need (or want) to
      fight. Nearly all Cultists have a higher War-Nature in when they're in
      The Rage. That's what The Rage is
      <em>for</em>. It not only has more tools to express the War-nature,
      people instinctively swap into it it when they know they're going to
      have to fight for their lives, or when they're expressing deep emotional
      pain.
    </p>

    <h3 id="concept_separation">Separating the Game Attributes</h3>

    <p>
      If you're having trouble figuring out exactly what's supposed to go into
      Natures, Core Values, and Professions, and why I'm saying that skill is
      part of Nature when it clearly belongs in a Profession, these concepts
      are <em>intentionally not well-separated</em> in this game. If you want
      a set of game attributes that doesn't overlap, here are two options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Remove Natures and
        <strong>play just with CVs and Professions</strong>. Use Professions
        to gate Expressions - keep the same minimum requirement but let the
        player choose appropriate Professions that are required instead of
        Nature. Make the Conflict total into CV x Profession, with any bonuses
        adding to Profession.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do the reverse: remove CVs and Professions and
        <strong>use just Natures</strong> in the game. Make the Conflict total
        into Nature x Nature, with any bonuses added to one side of that
        rather than both.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="what_nature_says">What Nature Says</h2>

    <p>
      As mentioned in Sorc (page 104), children are born without magic. Their
      effective Nature scores are 1. Where they go from there depends on how
      they grow up and who they become.
    </p>

    <h3 id="nature_1">Nature 1</h3>

    <p>
      In an adult, scores of 1 most often indicate a lack of interest in that
      particular area. Someone who doesn't have a deceptive bone in their body
      will have Trickery 1. Someone who wouldn't hurt a fly would have War 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their disinterest also means they won't train in that area. Their lack
      of skill means that their effective Nature will be low even if they
      suddenly wish it weren't. Scores of 1 can be a result of not receiving
      any experience or training in a particular area. It's
      <em>possible</em> for a very productive person who enjoys making things
      with their hands to have Industry 1, but it's very unlikely. In our
      world, the equivalent would be someone who says they love crafting but
      have never learned to knit, never practiced whittling, doesn't garden,
      doesn't cook, and in short have evaded almost every opportunity to learn
      and practice the arts of Indutry.
    </p>

    <p>
      People raised in Null Zones always have an <em>effective</em> score of 1
      in their Natures. While it might make sense for e.g. a very
      compassionate person to have Communion 2 or higher, a lack of flow makes
      it impossible for them to access the benefits of their true selves.
      Returners raised outside a null zone, where flow is broadly available,
      <em>actuall do</em> have Natures limited to 1. They're been raised to
      avoid strong emotions. As you can guess, this kind of mental
      conditioning doesn't always work.
    </p>

    <h3 id="nature_2_4">Nature 2-4</h3>

    <p>
      Growing children, adolescents, and young adults raise their Natures by
      following their interests and learning more about them. Most adults will
      have Nature scores between 2 and 4.
    </p>

    <p>
      People with Nature 2 or 4 are what you might think of as "normally
      interested" in a particular area. You might say, "If want to learn some
      shapechanging tricks, talk to Ley-Star-Wealth. They're really into it."
      Or, "Sprint of Seventh Ward? Yeah, she never really liked geometry,
      can't conjure a sturdy house to save her life." They're within the
      typical expected range of interests and abilities in the Basin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nature 3 is a fairly common baseline across the Basin. Certain Natures
      can be lower in certain civilizations. War, especially, is lower across
      more peaceful regions. Other Natures tend to be day-to-day requirements
      for life and society. Nature 3 has a number of very enticing benefits:
      Universal Repositories, improved Immortality, Travel, reading people
      more effectively, pranking people with the Shell Game... These things
      are a <em>big deal</em>, especially when your peer group has them and
      you don't. They're marks of adulthood.
    </p>

    <h3 id="nature_5">Nature 5</h3>

    <p>
      Nature 5 requires a lot of interest and a lot of effort, with the former
      typically leading to the latter. Nature 5 isn't truly <em>rare</em> -
      you'll find quite a few people with Nature 5 in any given city - but
      this level comes from a substantial focus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nature 5 doesn't have a lot of new techniques as compared with Nature 4,
      at least in the game as written so far. However, it's still twice as
      fast in Rituals, more potent, and opens up a few odd tricks that people
      won't expect and don't always plan for. Even in a world where everyone's
      a magician, Nature 5 is a step above. As the average magical prowess of
      the Basin increases (see
      <a href="#advance_of_magic">The Advance Of Magic</a> below), these will
      become game-changers in the lives of people across the world.
    </p>

    <h3 id="maintain_nature">Maintaining Natures</h3>

    <p>Maintaining Nature 1 or 2 takes nothing.</p>

    <p>
      Maintaining Nature 3 takes some work, but not a lot. Leisure time is
      fairly commonly available across the Basin, so most people find a few
      hours a week to "work out", as it were.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maintaining Nature 4 and 5 takes more work, so they're generally
      connected to someone's role in society. Profession and Nature are
      mutually reinforcing in this world. A healer finds it much easier to
      maintain Communion 5 because it's the muscle they use day in and day
      out. A scholar's high Mystery score is kept sharp by the translation
      work they do.
    </p>

    <h3 id="advance_of_magic">The Advance Of Magic</h3>

    <p>
      The average magical prowess of Basin natives is increasing with time.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the Gift was given, everyone had an effective Nature cap of 3. Many
      spells were unknown, or known only to a handful of magi like the
      Fellowship of Truth or the Geometer's Guild. Most people didn't know
      efficient processes by which to attain a deeper connection with their
      Natures. Even if someone managed to attain a Nature of 4 or 5, they had
      no tools with which to express it. Their <em>effective</em>
      Nature was still 3. Even the Fellowship and the Geometers were capped at
      3 at that time. The Gift opened up a greater potential in them, but they
      couldn't take advantage of it. Many people were stuck at 2 until they
      stole, rediscovered, or invented new Expressions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, as magical research and archaeology expanded the tools
      available, Nature 4 and 5 became accessible. People also learned
      effective ways to reach higher Nature scores faster. This process of
      growth hasn't stopped. Some time in the not-too-distant future, Nature 6
      will be just as accessible as Nature 5 is now. The exact timeline for
      this is left up to the GM, but it's unlikely to be a smooth and uniform
      transition. Some Natures will no doubt come earlier by coincidence or
      necessity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Will there be Nature 7 eventually? Yes. Nature 8, 9, 10? Yes. Some day,
      Nature 5 will be what people achieve when they're not very interested in
      what they're doing. It's going to be a hell of a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to play this process out, go for it. You might have a game
      that skips centuries, or one where all of this happens in a rapidly
      accelerating singularity scenario. (We recommend allowing higher
      Profession levels as well, since using a Profession involves magic for
      nearly everyone.)
    </p>

    <h2 id="change_trad">Changing Traditions</h2>
    <p>
      What's the process for changing Traditions? What does your character
      actually <em>do</em>, and why does it cost Reserve?
    </p>

    <p>
      In game terms, a Tradition is a Path, a Fount, and a set of Core
      Expressions. In the <em>world</em> of the game, a Tradition encompasses
      much more. It's a way of thinking, a set of tools, and an approach to
      life. It's a connection to a universal emanation of power. Traditions
      are enmeshed with culture and mindset.
    </p>

    <p>
      To switch Traditions, a magus puts down the tools of their old trade and
      takes up new ones. In simpler cases they put away dusts and powders and
      ready a compass and stylus, or perhaps clear their voice and take a deep
      breath to sing. Other magi have greater challenges. Those who walk the
      path of Belief must put those beliefs down. Those with Patrons must
      beseech and appease them. Even two Traditions that share a Path will
      have differences in interpretation and intent. As anyone who has learned
      multiple languages or martial arts styles knows, sometimes the closest
      pairings are the hardest to keep separate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Changing Traditions costs Reserve because all of that takes effort and
      creates waste. Blood magic requires an initial investment. Wild magic
      disrupts other effects. Careful procedures can mitigate these issues,
      but the very mindset of caution is not conducive to some forms of magic!
      In the end, only extensive practice makes the transition smooth - or as
      smooth as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Twist effects of changing Traditions come purely from metagame
      concerns. There's no in-world effect, so there's no in-world
      justification needed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="everyday_magic">Everyday Magic</h2>

    <p>
      If you walk down a stereotypical street in any given civilization, what
      does it look like? What's happening that might be suprising to someone
      who isn't used to it? The corebook already covers some of this, so I'll
      skip details that have already been discussed.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>the Cult</strong>: Most people are a bit see-through. Their
        birthmarks are cool colors instead of warm ones. You'll still see
        children (also ghosts) and pets (sometimes ghosts, but not always)
        running and playing.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Diadem</strong>:</li>
      <li><strong>Glimmermere</strong>:</li>
      <li><strong>the Ægis</strong>:</li>
      <li><strong>the Guild</strong>:</li>
      <li><strong>the Hearth-Kin</strong>:</li>
      <li><strong>Nova</strong>:</li>
      <li><strong>the Sovereigns</strong>:</li>
      <li><strong>Those Above</strong>:</li>
      <li><strong>the Unroyal</strong>:</li>
      <li>
        <strong>the Worldbuilders</strong>: When you come across another
        person during the day they're likely to be at work, many of them
        contributing to the rituals that
        <a href="Infrastructure#raise_strata">call pieces of the city from the distant past</a>.
        After work, many people have artistic hobbies - you'll see a lot of
        animated murals, walking statues, and impossible architecture. You're also likely to see
        a few spirits connected to the city, its structure, and its elements.
        Some people will be in elemental form, usually air or earth. The
        weather will never be too extreme, though during festivals it might be
        psychedelic.
