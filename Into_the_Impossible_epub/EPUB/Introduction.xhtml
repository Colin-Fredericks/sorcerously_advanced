      <em>“The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond
        them into the impossible.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>-- Arthur C. Clarke</p>
    <p>
      In our world, the word “impossible” has real meaning. Some things can
      happen, though they might be very improbable. Other things simply
      cannot. It may feel smothering, but unbreakable laws of nature are
      honestly pretty great. Our world’s limits provide us a place to live: a
      tiny interface between crushing pressure and unbreathable vacuum. If all
      things were possible, many of those things would not be the least bit
      beneficial to humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Sorcerously Advanced is not a scientific universe, and the
      people there are nowhere near discovering the limits of their magic - if
      it even has limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that spirit, let us venture a bit beyond what has been possible and
      stretch toward the impossible, to see what it has in store for us.
