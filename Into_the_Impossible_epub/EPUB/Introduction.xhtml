      <em>“The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond
        them into the impossible.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>-- Arthur C. Clarke</p>
    <p>
      In our world, the word “impossible” has real meaning. Some things can
      happen, though they might be very improbable. Other things simply
      cannot. This may feel smothering, but unbreakable laws of nature are
      honestly pretty great. Our world’s limits provide us a place to live: a
      tiny interface between crushing pressure and harsh vacuum. If all things
      were possible, many of those things would not be the least bit
      beneficial to humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Sorcerously Advanced is not a scientific universe, and the
      people there are nowhere near discovering the limits of their magic - if
      it even has limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that spirit, let us venture a bit beyond what has been possible and
      stretch toward the impossible, to see what it has in store for us.
    </p>

    <p>This book is broken into four chapters:</p>
    <p>
      The <strong>New Expressions</strong> chapter introduces about a dozen
      new spells for your characters to discover. Some are well-known
      throughout the Basin, but most are recently recovered by the Archive
      - or, depending on your GM’s plans, soon to be recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Mystical Infrastructure</strong> gives more detail on
      Infrastructure-level Expressions, including commonly-used techniques for
      diverting flow, devastating environmental attacks, and ways to hide
      entire nations from observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <strong>The Broken and the Lost</strong> we cover two kinds of
      archaic magic: failed attempts to create Grand Wonderworks, and
      specialized Arts that have fallen out of use over the centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the <strong>Useful References</strong> chapter includes a list
      of spells categorized by descriptor (Connection, Loud, or Silent), and
      lists of suggested aspects for each Expression.
