        Sorcerously Advanced is a speculative fiction game of cutting edge
        magic, set in the distant aftermath of a mystical singularity called The
        Gift: a day when every living person and all their descendants received
        incredible magical power. As envoys, guards, and archaeologists for the
        Archive, your characters will seek out magical relics and irreplaceable
        records from ages long past to circulate across the world. They will
        navigate disputed territories, uncover ancient clues, and travel to
        strange, distant realms. This is only part of the danger in a world
        where overwhelming power is freely distributed... and not everyone is on
        board with the Archive's goals. Sorcerously Advanced is about the
        effects of life-changing power on people and their societies. It’s about
        beliefs and decisions, and the impacts they have. It’s about the endless
        nature of knowledge. Most of all, it’s about what it really means to
        become everything you ever wanted.
