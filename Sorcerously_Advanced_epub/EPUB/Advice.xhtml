      You’re all powerful wizards, you’re all immortal and practically unkillable,
      <strong>and</strong> you’re basically all either librarian-archaeologists or
      working for them.
    </p>
    <p>So that’s a little weird.</p>
    <p>
      In this chapter, I, the game designer, am going to speak directly to you, the
      reader, about this game and why it is the way it is. Hopefully this will help
      you have more fun with this game. This section is primarily aimed at Game
      Masters, but Players are welcome to read too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items in this section are arranged in the rough order that I expect
      they'll show up in most peoples' games. The latter items aren't less
      important, but a lot of groups can play for a while without running
      into them.

        This section lists books, games, movies, and more that led to the creation of
        this game. None of them are a perfect match for it. This is a weird game, and
        I had to piece it together from a lot of different sources.
      </p>

      <h3 id="books">Books</h3>
      <p>
        Earthpower was strongly inspired by both
        <strong>the Broken Earth trilogy</strong> (N.K. Jemisin) and
        <strong>the Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</strong> (Stephen Donaldson).
      </p>
      <p>
        Alchemy has roots not only in our world’s European and Taoist alchemy and in
        D&amp;D-type magic, but also in the magic portrayed in the
        <strong>Oz series</strong> by L. Frank Baum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elementalism, beyond its many real-world inspirations, also drew from
        <strong>Celestial Matters</strong> (Richard Garfinkle) for its high-end
        magitech applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original six books of the <strong>Elric saga</strong> (Michael Moorcock)
        show what Patron-based magic looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        The art of Rapport was inspired in part by kything from
        <strong>A Wind In The Door</strong> (Madeline L’Engle).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Diskworld series</strong> (Terry Pratchett) not only gave us the
        term “thaum” but also a world where no organizations are without some blemish,
        and few are irredeemable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Mahabharata</strong> and the <strong>Ramayana</strong> provide
        excellent benchmarks for character power, as well as good examples for the
        Glory fount. In the Basin,
        <strong>thousands of people in each city-state</strong> are that powerful.
      </p>

      <h3 id="comics">Comics</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Kill Six Billion Demons</strong> (Abbadon). Fantastic work, set in a
        bizarre and baroque hell (and more than a little grotesque in places). There
        are a lot of books and comics that don’t live up to their titles, but in this
        one you really get the feeling that by the end of the story, some motherfucker
        is gonna kill six billion demons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oneiromancy drew substantial inspiration from
        <strong>The Sandman</strong> (Neil Gaiman).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Top Ten</strong> (Alan Moore / Gene Ha / Zander Cannon) is a good
        example of a setting where everyone has super-powers.
        <strong>Promethea</strong>, another Alan Moore creation (with fantastic art by
        JH Williams III), has some great rules-of-magic bits that would fit well into
        Sorc. Warning: neither of these has aged particularly well. There are parts of
        Promethea that were considered extremely problematic even when they were
        initially published (I’m looking at you, issue #10).
      </p>
      <p>
        Most wizard characters in comics aren’t great examples for Sorcerously
        Advanced. Their powers just do what the writers want them to do that month.
        The general feel is often right, though. <strong>Mystic</strong>, the comic
        book series from Crossgen (Ron Marz / Brandon Peterson / John Dell) (not the
        more recent Marvel version) is probably the best fit for Sorc. The central
        character has to learn many different kinds of magic, each of which comes from
        its own culture. Unfortunately the series is long out of print and almost
        impossible to find these days.

      <p>
        <strong>Nobilis</strong> and <strong>Glitch</strong> (both Jenna Moran) are
        games about weird high-powered fantasy with a modern setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mage</strong>, either <strong>Ascension</strong> or
        <strong>Awakening</strong> (White Wolf and Onyx Path, respectively). Both
        games involve wizards of fairly low power level (at least until you give them
        time to prep), but the underlying ideas of symbolism, tradition, and multiple
        approaches to the same goal were very influential on Sorc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Exalted</strong> (Onyx Path). Oh you start with a spell called Chill
        Touch? That’s cute. I start with a spell called Death of Obsidian Butterflies.
        Solar charms are a great example of a Discipline → Glory Tradition, whereas
        the Dragon-blooded charms lead to Elementalism instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mythender</strong> (Ryan Macklin) hits the power level approximately
        right: you’re god-hunters who will probably eventually become gods, at which
        point your friends will be obliged to hunt you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>Everway</strong> (Jonathan Tweet / WotC) hits the feel of
        Sorc’s multiverse, with many worlds that would fit well into the Kaleidoscope
        and an elemental approach to magic that helped inform Sorc’s own elementalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mystic Empyrean</strong> (Brad Talton), for both its similarity to the
        Kaleidoscope and for the way your character’s actions and personality define
        their powers and their bodies. Mystic Empyrean characters all have amazing
        levels of Becoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few D&amp;D supplements, especially <strong>Dragon Kings</strong> (2e) and the
        <strong>Planescape</strong> boxed set (2e). Relevant third-party supplements
        include <strong>The Dreams of Ruin</strong> and
        <strong>Immortals Handbook</strong>, both of which worked hard to actually
        handle extending D&amp;D’s setting to high-powered characters and what they were
        capable of.
      </p>

      <h3 id="nonfiction">Nonfiction</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>The Sandia Report</strong>, most easily found under its full title,
        “Expert judgment on markers to deter inadvertent human intrusion into the
        Waste Isolation Pilot Plant”. How do you mark a space that’s so dangerous it
        could be deadly to enter ten thousand years later?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Geometer’s Guild was inspired by the <strong>Pythagoreans</strong> of
        ancient Greece, a cult that blended religion and geometry.

        Changes from Sufficiently Advanced
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sorcerously Advanced (Sorc for short) shares its core rules with the second
        edition of Sufficiently Advanced (SA2), my game about the impacts of advanced
        technology in the far future. While there are obviously massive differences in
        the setting of these two games, and some clear rules differences (the change
        from Themes to Approaches being the biggest), I wanted to point out a few
        things that are particularly important.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sorcerously Advanced takes place in a <strong>non-sciencing universe</strong>.
          Magic is not just a different kind of science in this game, it is
          <a href="#ascientific">fundamentally non-mathematizable</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sufficiently Advanced was created to be the story of humanity. Everything you
          can play is either human or was created by human beings. Sorcerously Advanced
          is a game with a wider focus. It’s about a broader definition of “people” than
          just humanity. Both games are about what people can become when their
          limitations are removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          SA2 has Metatech and Sorc doesn’t. This might seem like a weird thing to say –
          none of the other stats cross between games. Why point out this one? Because
          Metatech is the only stat from Suff that doesn’t even have an equivalent in
          Sorc. Sorcerously Advanced has no generic social powerhouse attribute.
          Communion will get you connections, and Trickery will fool people, but nothing
          will talk your opponents over to your point of view with the amazing facility
          and speed that a high-Metatech character is capable of. This has a lot of
          knock-on effects for the setting as well, such as...
        </li>
        <li>
          The Great Basin is far more warlike than most of the universes presented in
          SA2. There are no “hot wars” going on at the default game start, but they’re
          imminent, not to mention all the conflict happening elsewhere in the Basin and
          the proxy wars conducted in nearby nations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both games are optimistic, but Sorc’s civilizations are a lot more flawed than
          those in SA2.
        </li>
        <li>
          Technology in SA2 is more advanced than magic in Sorc. It’s been around for
          longer, is more reliable, and has fewer side-effects.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are some minor rules changes – swapping out Themes for Approaches, the
        number of Twists you get – but those are more about atmosphere than actual
        game effect.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="chapter" title="What Sorc does Well" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="what_sorc_does_well">What Sorc does Well</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond any other considerations, Sorcerously Advanced supports games that hate
        the status quo. Sorc’s wheelhouse includes stories of technological or
        mystical innovation, investigation and mystery, politics, first contact, and
        revolution. Subplots revolving around ethical dilemmas, conflicting
        objectives, romance, and the “stranger in a strange land” narrative are all
        well-supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        The civilizations of the Great Basin are unstable. Magical research is
        fast-moving and only going faster. Every civilization has something
        fundamentally immoral going on. With powerful characters, Twist use, Rituals,
        and especially Plots, Sorc supports
        <strong>games where the world changes long-term</strong>. There is an
        expectation that your players will create new things, find the things they
        dislike and change them, and that these will have knock-on effects for the
        rest of the setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorcerously Advanced supports <strong>moral dilemmas</strong> in sort of an
        odd way: it gets you to them faster. For example, investigations might take 8
        hours in-game but 30 seconds out-of-game. It’s what you discover and how you
        intend to act on it that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Culture clashes</strong> are also going to be common sources of plot.
        With so much of magic dependent on one’s culture (e.g. Becoming, Conjuration),
        the ways that each civilization deals with sex, gender, disability, ethnicity,
        and belief are paramount questions. No ethical stance is without a potential
        consequence, be it physical, mental, or mystical.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s easy to create a game where most of what characters face are
        <strong>repercussions of their own decisions</strong>. A starting mission full
        of difficult choices can help to set the scene for this, as can antagonists
        who don’t give a damn about the common good.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Action-oriented games</strong> work better in Sorc than in SA2, for
        two reasons. A: Everyone has a War Approach that can help their characters
        survive or be effective. B: Death and wounds are much less serious
        consequences in this game, thanks to the ubiquity of healing magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Black-ops</strong> and <strong>diplomatic</strong> games are
        well-supported. I find it particularly rewarding to run a single game with
        both elements, plus the standard Archive investigation/dig happening at the
        same time. This is also a good way to have a little bit of party conflict
        without having it balloon out of proportion: the black-ops team and the
        diplomats both have the same goals, but they would likely argue over the right
        methods to use, and meanwhile the dig team is finding something that could
        change the whole situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, <strong>recurring enemies</strong> are fairly easy to create. It’s
        extremely difficult to kill anyone in this setting, and cloning and
        resurrection also exist. The more your villain is entertaining rather than
        frustrating, the more likely they are to stick around for the long term Just
        expect the players to eventually go after their Core Values, successfully.
        Then they’ll have an ally who’s willing to tell them what the bigger plan was
        about and who’s involved in it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what_sorc_does_bad">What Sorc Doesn’t Do</h3>
      <p>
        Sorcerouly Advanced is not a generic fantasy sandbox. It won’t let you play
        every wizard you’ve ever read about in a fantasy book, played in another RPG,
        or played in a video game. Things will work differently than you might expect.
        I wanted to write this section so that you don’t accidentally create a game
        that will immediately fall apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorc’s universe, much like the game itself, runs on a set of rules that cover
        an extensive but not necessarily complete range of circumstances. When
        circumstances fall between the established rules, the results are uncertain.
        The universe in Sorc is
        <strong>knowable but not necessarily reliable or controllable</strong>. If
        your players demand total internal consistency, this universe does not have
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Player characters in Sorcerously Advanced are powerful, whether magically or
        otherwise. However, the exercise of power does not solve, and in may cases
        <strong>cannot</strong> solve, the issues raised by the game’s themes.
        Instead, it <strong>complicates</strong> them. Sorcerously Advanced as written
        will never be a “beat the boss to bring down the organization” kind of game.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can run a super-wizard game, where high-Power magi run roughshod over
        lower-Power opposition. However, that’s not the default. If you want to set up
        the PCs as substantially more powerful than everyone else, you’ll either want
        to give them reasons to visit Returner cults, or you’ll need to make major
        changes to the setting. In most campaigns the people your characters meet will
        be roughly on par with them in terms of magical and mundane skill. Unlike in
        RPGs with substantial character advancement, there is no point at which the
        characters in Sorc will become more powerful than everyone else in the
        setting. You might need to remind your players of this at some point. I
        suggest doing this via out-of-game conversations before you do it via in-game
        means, but when you need those in-game means, they are available in spades.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Natures, Professions, and CVs are rated in such large steps, Sorc
        doesn’t handle fine detail very well. Nearly every Returner character will
        have the exact same Nature scores. Similarly, someone with 12 years of
        practice in a Profession and someone with 8 years of practice both have a
        rating of 2. If you want a game that can handle a lot of small differences
        between characters with ease, Sorc isn’t that game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorc handles “hex-crawl” style games extremely poorly. Investigations tend to
        happen quickly in terms of out-of-game time – it might take 8 hours in-game,
        but less than a minute of negotiation with the GM handles the whole scene.
        There are no traps or structures that will stall the typical team for more
        than a minute. If you want to run the kind of session where travel happens by
        foot and physical structures present a challenge, you’ll need to set it in a
        Null Zone. Even then, someone’s going to throw around some Reserve when they
        really need to use magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can do action-oriented games, but you can’t really do tactical ones.
        Players only make strategic decisions in Sorc; the tactical decisions are
        skipped over and subsumed into the characters’ skill ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Murder mysteries require a great deal of work to make them believable. The
        amount of information-gathering that the average team will have at its
        fingertips is astounding – one person will have Psychometry, someone else
        might have Precognition, and high Mystery scores will solve locked-room
        puzzles with comparative ease. Characters with significant Communion scores
        will intuit the relationships between the victim and their friends (and
        enemies) with minimal effort, quickly narrowing down the possible suspects.
        For a whodunnit-type murder to be a big deal, it has to be nearly impossible
        to figure out what happened and pin the evidence on them. They’re going to
        burn the evidence to thwart psychometry, use multiple personae to confuse
        Communion, and more. Even then, many Approaches can slice through this kind of
        problem like a hot knife through butter. This doesn’t mean that using murders
        as plot elements is a bad idea. Far from it, in fact. It just means that 99%
        of those who murder will be counting on being caught.

    <section class="chapter" title="Points of Canon Uncertainty" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="points_of_canon_uncertainty">Points of Canon Uncertainty</h2>
      <p>
        There are some questions that are intentionally unanswered in this book. These
        are left for individual game masters to answer. There’s a difference between
        “I forgot it” and “I’m intentionally not explaining it”, and this list is the
        latter. Even if I write supplements for this game, I’ll never give a
        definitive answer to these questions.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mundane Matters</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Was there in fact a previous age where magic was common? How long ago? Was
          there more than one?</li>
        <li>What happens if you touch Aion?</li>
        <li>Is the Kaleidoscope infinite? How many worlds are in it, and why?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Matters of Magic</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What price did Aion pay for the Gift?</li>
        <li>What was the original purpose of the Uncountable Spinners of Silver Cord?</li>
        <li>What are the unresolvable contradictions that make magic fundamentally
          unscientific?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Matters of Theology</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Why was the Gift given?</li>
        <li>Is it possible to communicate with Aion?</li>
        <li>Are nature spirits and the gods of the Worlds Beyond the same sort of being?
          Is Aion the same sort of being?</li>
        <li>Does every world in the Kaleidoscope have a different Aion, or are they all
          part of the same being?</li>
        <li>How close are we, exactly, to the end of the Kalpa?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Again, answers to these questions aren’t “missing from the book”, they are
        canonically undecided. I wanted to explicitly point them out as plot fodder.
        I’d rather give you hooks to create and unravel your own mysteries than try to
        build some sort of vast and probably unsatisfying metaplot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of canon uncertainty was borrowed from the game
        <strong>In Nomine</strong>, in which the nature of various religious figures,
        the existence of free will, etc. were all points of “Canon Doubt and
        Uncertainty”.

    <section class="chapter" title="Adjudicating Effects" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="adjudicating_effects">Adjudicating Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Complications can sometimes be tricky to handle. Suddenly one of the
        characters is going to be injured, or kidnapped, or even brainwashed. These
        are substantial changes to the game fiction, not something that can be swept
        under the rug.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GM shoulders the majority of this burden. It’s typically easy to work an
        injury into a game (during a battle, for instance, or via disease, or even by
        saying that one of the characters thoughtlessly walks out into traffic), but a
        kidnapping is a different matter. Think for a minute about whether it makes
        sense for the current set of problems to include a kidnapping. If not, perhaps
        the player should pick a different Complication. The GM also has the option to
        push the consequences off until the next session, when a different threat has
        come along.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages can be just as tricky. Huge windfalls of information, especially,
        can be tough to handle. This is especially true since certain Approaches (e.g.
        those for Mystery) are specifically intended to provide such things. Asking a
        player to come up with a different Advantage isn’t really appropriate in that
        situation. This is where creating a thickly layered plot is important. If
        there’s only one mystery in your game, and solving it wraps everything up in a
        nice bow, that game will be over very quickly. Mysteries should lead to
        conflicts, which should lead to interactions, which should lead to more
        mysteries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Complications don’t make sense for some characters, or will need to be
        tailored appropriately. Someone playing a ninja-like espionage agent would be
        seriously compromised by a Complication involving public embarrassment, so it
        should count as more than trivial. Likewise, an unsympathetic character with
        no friends would not be particularly hurt losing friends, so such
        Complications shouldn’t count for such a high level. It’s best for the GM and
        players to talk these things over for before they come up in-game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complications aren’t intended to be “min-maxed” the way Nature scores are.
        They’re intended to be the <strong>balance</strong> to those scores. If
        someone with high Nature score is abusing a particular Complication over and
        over again without any trouble coming out of it, you have the right to ask
        them to stop using that Complication – or to make it more trouble than they
        were looking for. Again, out-of-game conversation is often the best way to
        handle these kinds of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I encourage you to remember that, while Complications are meant to be
        a bad thing, they are also meant to be overcome. Similarly, Advantages are
        often fleeting. Even the strongest Effects should disappear in two or three
        game sessions of serious work, and most should be over by the end of the
        session.
      </p>

      <h3 id="taking_complications">Taking Complications Like a Pro</h3>
      <p>
        The secret is this: don’t stop your character’s story. Don’t stop anyone
        else’s story. Instead, take Complications that drive the action, that draw you
        further into the plot.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you’re taking your own Complications, don’t ask to be knocked out,
        silenced, or delayed. Don’t bog down your character with a court appearance or
        the need to fall back to a safe places. Not unless you need a break (out-of-
        game) to take a trip to the bathroom. All of these Complications take your
        character out of the action, and leave you with nothing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, take a Complication that forces you to be creative. Get a Nature
        disabled – now you need to use a different one. Get hit with a curse that
        prevents you from thinking about your enemy – now you need to concentrate on
        her henchmen. Accelerate your opponent’s plans – now you need to work faster
        to stop him. Your characters are awesome. Take the opportunity to play them
        more. Put them in a tight place and figure out how they’ll react.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite Complications involve getting kidnapped, being befriended by the
        enemy, having my position revealed, or being convinced of something that isn’t
        true but that my character would need to act on. All of these give me things
        to do in the game, in addition to getting me some Twists. Will my character’s
        life be harder as a result? Absolutely! If it wasn’t, the Big Deal rule would
        keep me from getting any Twists. However, I still get to act – no, I
        <strong>need</strong> to act. These Complications make the game both harder
        and more fun, and I really enjoy that sort of challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short: Don’t take Complications that will end on their own. Take
        Complications that you need to fix.

      <h2 id="world_in_flux">A World in Flux</h2>
      <p>
        For the first ten years after the Gift, it was armageddon. For the next
        hundred, it was “merely” war. The Basin lost untold thousands of civilizations
        all across its immense surface. Waves of conquerors swept the lands, and
        nations rose and fell quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The past 200 years have been more peaceful, but change has been fast and
        sometimes harsh. Civilizations build around magic have only recently begun to
        truly adapt to its implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that reason, the characters in your game may have the opportunity to face
        major societal and technological problems, and shape how the world responds to
        them. As Archivists they’re respected by many. Their words and recommendations
        carry weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are a few things the Archive might be faced with in the coming years.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ticking_time_bombs">
        Ticking Time Bombs, or,
        The Unyielding Advance of Thaumaturgical Research
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are several possible – perhaps even likely – events coming up in the
        Basin’s future that have the potential to cause massive disruption. Here are
        just a few of the magical issues facing the Basin, along with the particular
        habits and conventions with which they collide.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Becoming</strong>, <strong>Shapeshifting</strong>,
          and <strong>Transcendence</strong>: The art of Becoming is probably the single
          most important, most influential “spell” in the entire setting. You can’t
          understand Sorcerously Advanced and the current (and future) status of the
          Great Basin without understanding Becoming. Magical researchers and
          philosophers want to know: what are the limits of self-transformation?
          Especially changes to one’s mind – when will your friends consider you a
          different person? When will the law consider you one?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Burning Dream</strong>: If a whole society knew this art, their
          enemies would fear sleep itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conjuration and Cloning</strong>: Already there are crops that need no
          longer be farmed, animals that need not be tended. What will the worth of a
          handcrafted work be? Who will take the risk of making things by hand, knowing
          they can be used as mystic connections?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Curses</strong>: Because they can react to each other and change
          objects, you could run computations with them. Who’s going to be first to make
          that mistake – to design the computer that runs on spite?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dream Travel and Dreamshaping</strong>: Why live in the Basin when you
          can shape these worlds so much more easily? How will children grow up in a
          world that responds to their thoughts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Geometric Monoculture</strong>: The Sacred Geometry of the Guild is
          flexible and powerful, but they’re a monoculture – they bring in few outside
          ideas and propagate themselves without change. This makes them uniquely
          vulnerable to new breeds of flow parasites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Immortality and Healing</strong>: This is more of a slow burn than a
          time bomb, but every civlization in the entire Kaleidoscope is going to have
          to cope with the fact that no one is dying any more. People are beginning to
          realize they will never inherit from their parents. Compound interest
          continues to make the rich richer, except in the few places that have managed
          to rid themselves of it. Prison sentences “for life” become untenable. What
          happens to the sanity of someone imprisoned in a volcano, or even simply
          starved forever, refusing to die?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Invasive Species</strong>: It’s not difficult to create new living
          beings. A little nature-work, a little mystical servitor ritual... How long
          until someone releases an animal or plant that outcompetes all others?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ley Lines</strong>: Those Above the Sky hold a near-monopoly on nearby
          ley line access. Eventually someone’s going to break that, whether it’s one of
          the civilizations in this book or a group from the wider Basin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mental Acuity</strong>: What happens when a percentage of the
          population realizes that a certain major change would result in substantial
          improvements... but everyone else is literally not smart enough to accomplish
          it? How will the intelligencia act on their convictions?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mnemosurgery and Personae</strong>: Mnemosurgery is already feared
          across the Basin. When will a civilization rise that makes full use of it, and
          of Personae, tailoring citizens’ memories to alter their beliefs?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mystic Servitors and Multitasking</strong>: It’s already true that no
          one in the Basin needs to work to live. What happens when people realize that
          no one needs to work to make someone else’s dreams come true – that people can
          make their own workforces if they put in the effort? Will there be relief or
          resentment?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>the Overmind</strong>: Eventually someone’s going to find out a way
          in. They’re going to hack the Overmind and exploit the mystic connection
          between all Ægis members.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Precognition</strong>: What is this art even doing? What are its
          implications for the nature of time?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Psychometry and Spirit-walking</strong>: The Basin hasn’t scratched
          the surface of magic’s potential for surveillance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rapport</strong>, <strong>Farspeech</strong>,
          <strong>and True Speech</strong>: What happens to spoken language when no one
          needs to learn it?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Superweapons</strong>: The Ten-Crore Stones are only one of many
          ancient superweapons. Nova is investigating more of them every year, sometimes
          to understand them, sometimes to rebuild them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temporal Magic</strong>: The Worldmakers are undergoing a population
          explosion. That’s going to reverse at some point as the people who were
          “pulled from the future” begin disappearing from the present to travel to the
          past. How will they handle their massive territory in the face of this
          population collapse?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Night No One Slept</strong>: It hasn’t happened yet. What happens
          to the Dream Realms if someone engineers this?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Red Space</strong>: How many people are already trapped here?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Shell Game and Universal Repositories</strong>: The Basin has only
          begun to see the potential of these arts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Soul-work and The Uncountable Spinners</strong>: There are thousands,
          perhaps millions of individuals trapped in Soul Repositories across the Basin.
          Why were they locked away?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Weather-work</strong>: Who decides whether there will be rain today?
          What impact does it have on nature spirits?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finally, there are implications inherent in the nature of magic and the world.
        This world is ascientific. Let’s get into that right here.
      </p>

      <h3 id="ascientific">An Ascientific World</h3>
      <p>
        Our universe is one that can be fundamentally described through mathematics.
        Sometimes the math is too hard for us to solve perfectly, but that doesn’t
        mean it doesn’t apply. Scientific methods work in our universe – if you repeat
        an action under the exact same conditions, you get the exact same result.
        Statistical models work. Human beings have trouble using math and science, but
        when they’re applied correctly, they’re the most powerful methods we have for
        understanding and changing the universe.
      </p>
      <p>In the Basin, none of this is true.</p>
      <p>
        Now, clearly science works at least a little bit in the Basin, because a)
        people can measure things, and b) Nova Commonwealth is not purely delusional.
        You can gather information, make deductions, and often be correct. When you
        measure the length of a road, it’s always the same length. But there are no
        consistent hard-and-fast rules that apply in all situations. Every would-be
        scientific principle is merely a rule of thumb, and one can always find
        counter-examples.
      </p>
      <p>I want to emphasize: <strong>this is not how our world works</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        Let me give an example: in our world, the laws of aerodynamics prevent winged
        flight above a certain size. There are no birds the size of a jumbo jet. In
        the Basin, our usual expectations about aerodynamics typically hold – hot air
        rises, large birds soar rather than flapping, you can throw a paper airplane –
        and yet there are birds the size of a jumbo jet. (Anyone who’s about to bring
        up bumblebees, please go look that myth up first, because it was never true.)
        These elephant-snatching avians can fly not “because of magic”, or because of
        some other law that overrides aerodynamics, but simply because they are
        exceptions to the rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn’t have much of an impact on day-to-day game play beyond the GM
        being able to say, “Shut up about geology this 600-mile-high mountain exists
        because I said so.” But it has a <strong>massive</strong> bearing on the
        future of the Basin and the paths that civilizations will take.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Guild, Nova, and to a lesser extent the Cult are all researching magic
        under the presumption that there are true laws of magic that apply in all
        situations. This can get them a great distance. They can accomplish amazing
        things.
      </p>
      <p>However...</p>
      <p>
        …eventually, magical researchers will find things they can’t explain. If
        they’re flexible enough, they’ll bend around these things and be able to keep
        moving forward. If not, their worldviews will break, their civilizations will
        splinter, and it won’t be a peaceful process. Depending on the amount of
        hubris they show, all of this may manifest in the form of a devastating
        magitech disaster.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="chapter" title="No Dignity In Conquest" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="no_dignity_in_conquest">No Dignity In Conquest</h2>
      <p>
        Many of the Basin’s current civilizations (and those who fell before them)
        rose to power by exploiting weaker neighbors. Often this led to backlash
        – guerrilla attacks through the Lattice or from high above – but in the end
        those attacks harmed thousands while this game’s core civilizations harmed
        millions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dealing with a history of colonization and conquest is an important theme in
        this game. It’s not always front-and-center, but it’s woven through the fabric
        of multiple civilizations. This history is most obvious in the Diadem, but the
        Guild and Nova don’t have clean hands either. Even Those Above, who were
        driven away from the Basin by their neighbors, returned to put an economic
        stranglehold on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sovereigns are a special case. They’re <strong>so</strong> problematic
        that they let other civs downplay their own mistakes. They can always point
        and say “Well at least we’re not amoral demon-summoning edgelords.” It’s like
        having the drunk uncle who spouts racist conspiracy theories, letting you say
        “Well at least I’m not like <strong>that</strong>.” This sentiment, while
        true, doesn’t move anyone forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Archive has its own colonial tensions as well. On the one hand, it’s a
        multi-cultural endeavor that places long-lost knowledge within the Universal
        Repositories, from which all peoples can benefit. On the other hand, the
        civilizations of the Basin enable – even encourage! – the Archive to disturb
        burial grounds and holy sites in search of knowledge. They make their own
        closed-room decisions as to what is shared and what is considered forbidden.
        The Archive considers itself one of the Basin’s most virtuous organizations.
        Even if they’re right, there are still places where the Archive needs to
        recognize its own colonialist tendencies. Those will be rocky, difficult
        conversations that, even if successful, will shake the Archive to its core.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="chapter" title="Generating Moral Conflict" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="generating_moral_conflict">Generating Moral Conflict</h2>
      <p>
        Characters in Sorc are incredibly powerful. Whether it’s through in-game
        abilities (Nature scores and Expertise) or through meta-game abilities
        (Approaches), they get things done. When an entire group decides that there’s
        something important to do, they’ll probably find a way to do it, regardless of
        how difficult it might be. There may be tremendous sacrifices along the way,
        represented by Complications, but it’s hard to really stop a determined group.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question now becomes, “What do we actually want to do?” A lot of time in
        Sorcerously Advanced is typically spent answering that question. It’s the core
        of the game, the guts of the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the GM’s job is bringing the group to the point of debate. Setting a
        lot of opposition in front of the PCs is par for the course in any game, but
        this game needs a little extra – a little moral ambiguity that tugs on the
        characters’ beliefs. Here’s one way to generate that when you’re creating
        plots.
      </p>

      <h3 id="core_value_scales">Core Value Scales</h3>
      <p>
        While Core Values span the very broad range of human beliefs and morals, they
        also tend to fall into certain categories. Ninety percent or more of CVs can
        be seen as opinions about one or more of the following divisions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extremism / Balance</li>
        <li>Hedonism / Austerity</li>
        <li>Ephemeral / Tangible</li>
        <li>Change / Stasis</li>
        <li>Tradition / Heresy</li>
        <li>Control / Zen</li>
        <li>Self / Other / Community</li>
        <li>Will / Predestination / Chance</li>
        <li>Eternal / Limited / Cyclic</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Choices between these alternatives are clear only to those who have strong
        beliefs that pull them toward one end of the scale. For instance, a character
        with the Order CV will typically see Community as stronger than Self or Other,
        and will tend more toward Austerity than Hedonism. However, a character who
        believes in Emergence will not necessarily see any easy way to choose between
        those alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help you keep track of the entire party’s Core Values, you can use the
        Group Sheet. If you don’t have a copy, you can find one on the game’s wiki
        site: http://suffadv.wikidot.com/ It records the party’s Core Values in a
        visual way.
      </p>
      <p>
        When someone gives you a character sheet, put a big dot where their Core
        Values fall on each scale with a pencil or marker. When the group is finished
        you will see that some scales are weighted heavily on both ends, some are more
        toward the center, and some scales may have few or no marks on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most interesting scales are those where the PCs are either divided between
        the two ends, or where the scale is empty (perhaps with a few people near the
        middle). These are the places where it should be difficult for the characters
        to decide on a course of action.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, if half of the characters are on the Ephemeral side, and the
        other half are on the Tangible side, you may want to create a situation that
        has them choosing between a secular authority and a moral or religious one. If
        none of them have a strong feeling on the Change/Stasis scale, you may want to
        present the PCs with a choice between allying with a highly reliable and
        orthodox faction and allying with one that is more radical but less reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be able to create a moral quandary for a scale where all of the PCs
        are on one end, but where their definitions of the CV in question differ. The
        Extremism end of the Extremism/Balance scale is a common source for this –
        everyone tends to be extreme in their own personal ways. Ditto for the Heresy
        end of the Tradition/Heresy scale. You can also find potential debate points
        in the Control end of the Control/Zen scale, where different characters will
        want to see control exerted in different ways. Typically, however, when
        everyone is on the same end of a particular scale you’ll find it more
        difficult to create issues related to that belief.

        Is this section actually “Advice for Intentionally Creating Intra-Party
        Conflict?”
      </h3>
      <p>Yes and no.</p>
      <p>
        I feel the need to make a note here: There is no fun game in which the player
        characters can afford to have every ethical conflict come to blows. In most
        cases, the Archive’s higher-ups will not tolerate such behavior. In other
        cases, keeping a low profile is important, and fights in Sorc are typically
        easy to notice. Even Trickery conflicts can easily escalate to the level where
        bystanders are in danger. There are social pressures that keep the characters
        from going to war with one another over their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes things do come down to intra-party conflict. These can be very
        dramatic and memorable, but also very stressful. Try to reserve such moments
        for the ends of major plot arcs, or when someone has to leave the game for
        outside reasons.

        Characters in Sorcerously Advanced do not necessarily gain significant amounts
        of expertise or prowess as the game continues. For the more experienced
        roleplayers in the crowd: yes, this game has no XP. Most characters already
        have decades of experience under their belts, and some have centuries. There’s
        no standard way to make your character more and more powerful as time goes on.
        (This also means there’s no reason not to start off as powerful as you want to
        be.) However, there are some ways in which you can play a character who
        becomes more powerful as the game progresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lower-Power characters can always decide to have more mystical aids added to
        their bodies and souls, raising their Nature scores. War, Mystery, and
        Industry are common choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increasing your Professions takes practice and time – years of it.
        Unfortunately, that kind of spare time is in short supply in the average Sorc
        game. Increasing a Profession from 2 to 3 represents a minimum of twenty years
        of serious dedication and practice. It’s possible that your game might be run
        over that length of time, but it’s rare. It’s typically easier to obtain a new
        Mystical Expertise option via changes to your Core Expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of <a href="CharGen.xhtml#change_core_exp">altering Core Expressions</a>,
        this is probably the easiest way to
        change your character as the game goes on. Remember how spending a point of
        Reserve lets you cast a spell outside of your Core Expressions? That’s because
        you <strong>already know them</strong>. You don’t need to learn new spells,
        you just need to prepare differently, both physically and mentally. This might
        mean just changing what powders and elixirs you carry, or it might be a more
        significant change to your character’s personality. It all depends on your
        Path. Regardless, the art of Becoming gives you an excuse to change these
        sorts of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another possibility is to play a character who starts the game under the
        influence of a <a href="Magic.xhtml#Persona">persona</a>. This character has significant
        capabilities and loads of experience, but doesn’t remember it – it’s all
        hidden behind a veil of false memories. You should create your character as
        normal, and then “wall off” some of your levels in Professions and Natures, to
        be revealed when you decide. You could even leave some part of your true
        identity in the hands of the GM, if you prefer a more suspenseful and
        secret-filled game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tradeoff is that your Power and Import scores must remain balanced.
        Increasing your character’s highest Nature scores, or gaining a higher level
        of Expertise, will necessarily increase your Power and/or decrease your
        Import. This balance is not just there during character creation; it remains
        for the entire game. See the section on
        <a href="#hacking_the_game_mechanics">Hacking the Game Mechanics</a>
        for how to change this.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there is one thing you can change about your character without
        worrying about Power or Tech: You can change your character’s Core Values.
        Check out the <a href="CharGen.xhtml#change_mind">Changing Your Mind sidebar</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Losing a conflict can also result in your character having altered CVs.
        Brainwashing, long-lasting curses assaults, torture, even enchantments can
        help others break down your CVs and replace them with others. If your
        character wouldn’t want those things to happen, you’re still empowered to take
        Complications to shape your character’s story how you want.

        If you enjoy fiddling around with your games, creating house rules and
        variations on existing games, this section is for you. I’m going to talk about
        how the game is set up, why these choices were made, and give some advice for
        those who are interested in changing things.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the points I’m going to harp on here is that there are very few wrong
        choices in game design. There are definitely choices that might be harder to
        implement, or work less smoothly, or that might not fit well with your group
        of players, or that have results you don’t like. Just because you didn’t do
        anything wrong doesn’t mean everyone is a game design genius. However, as long
        as you don’t accidentally throw a negative sign into an equation, you can’t
        genuinely do things wrong.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s dig in.</p>
      <p>
        There are seven core game mechanics that you might want to alter. On the
        character side, we have basic actions, conflict, and projects. On the player
        side, we have twist use, plots, and the existentialism rules. Finally,
        connecting the two, we have Complications and Advantages, which are the most
        important part of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything else, like Infrastructure rules and all the little boxed rules in
        the Conflict and Twists sections, is fairly minor in comparison. Those rules
        are easy to change, and we’ll get into that in a moment.
      </p>

      <h3 id="game_mechanics_map">The Game Mechanics map</h3>
      <p>
        The diagram below shows how different parts of the game
        system interlock with one another. The player-level components are at
        the top of the image, and the character-level ones are at the bottom.
        Strong connections are made with solid purple curves; weak or
        conditional connections are made with light grey curves. You can
        see that the character side has more items, because this game has
        more structure for character-level actions than for player-level actions.
      </p>
      <p>
If you’d like to remove or change one part of the game system, this
        chart will give you a good idea of what else will be affected. The
        more central something is, the larger an impact it has. For instance,
        you can change how Professions work without affecting most of the
        rest of the game. Effects, on the other hand, have a central role, and
        any change to them will ripple down to the entire rest of the system.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Game_Mechanics_Chart.png" alt="Game mechanics chart as described below." />
        <figcaption>
          Plots, Twists, and Approaches are tightly connected. Twists, Effects, and
          Conflicts are closely connected. Conflicts are tightly connected to CVs,
          Natures, Professions, and Reserve. Basic Actions and Rituals are the least
          tightly connected.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3 id="changing_the_central_mechanics">Changing the Central Mechanics</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s start with the easy stuff: <strong>Rituals and Plots</strong>. The one
        and only important thing that these mechanics do is to serve as pacing
        devices. Plots are nothing more than an accumulation of Twists over time
        toward a specific goal. Rituals are, similarly, time and energy put in on the
        character level toward a specific goal. Their rules are almost exclusively
        about how long it takes to accomplish something.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want players to have less control over the long-term story of the game,
        you should make Plots harder to achieve. You might do this by requiring more
        Twists, or by requiring a more direct connection between the characters and
        the action (thus increasing the barrier for entry, and reducing the number of
        Plots the players can actually run). Players do tend to dump as many points as
        they can into Plots they really want to have happen, so you can expect a
        doubling of cost to double the amount of sessions it will take for a Plot to
        take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want players to have less ability to change the game world, cut down
        the effectiveness of time-steps when it comes to Rituals. Perhaps every two
        time-steps results in one shift on the chart. Perhaps you want to expand the
        chart so that a time step is less effective. As a useful point of reference,
        the inflection point for Rituals tends to be one day. If the characters can do
        something in a day, their players will generally have them do it. If it would
        take longer, they might look for another way around.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Basic Actions</strong> are surprisingly tough to change... because
        there’s really not much there. You just look at four things and decide. If you
        want to make things harder or easier, it’s less a matter of changing this rule
        and more a matter of being a hardass (or being generous) when it comes to
        interpreting this rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basic actions and conflict are where people typically start talking about
        wanting some randomness in the game. I’m not going to discuss about using dice
        (or other randomizers) in this section, because that would be a whole
        supplement unto itself. I couldn’t do it justice in one or two paragraphs
        here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of <strong>Conflict</strong>, this is probably the part of the system
        that is most amenable to tinkering. There are lots of modifiers to play around
        with, and plenty of alternative rules you could add in. If you’re interested
        in playing around with the Conflict system as it’s currently written, you
        should read down farther to the Changing Minor Rules header. Whether you’re
        looking to add some rules for different types of conflict, import the optional
        Impairment rules from SA2, or handle teamwork in a different way, you’ll find
        a helpful ranking of the different changes you can make. This should help you
        gauge how powerful your new rules will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re more in the mood to rip out the Conflict system and replace it, more
        power to you. I worked on a card-based system, an effort-based system, and
        more on my way to creating the current Conflict rules. They all used the same
        1-5 scale for character stats, though they connected to them in different
        ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the things I found most useful when designing the existing system was
        creating a spreadsheet with a dozen or so typical Conflicts, and then seeing
        what the results looked like and whether they made sense to me. If they didn’t
        make sense, I tweaked the game rules until they did. This can be helpful
        whether you’re building a really simple system or a really complex one.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also want to look at a book entitled “Design Patterns of Successful
        Role-Playing Games”. It’s easy to find a copy online, and it is distributed
        for free. Their diagramming techniques and descriptions of how various games
        work were very helpful to me. It’s not a light or easy read, but it’s very
        well-done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next up: <strong>Approaches</strong>. The easiest thing to do is to remove
        Approaches and replace them with Themes from SA2. This will narrow character
        options somewhat in terms of how they can use their Twists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, Approaches are disconnected from your character’s in-game
        specialties. You could make someone with elemental magic whose Approach to the
        War-nature is “Burn it all”, but you could also make the same character with
        an Approach that says “Brilliant strategist”. If you wanted, you could mandate
        a conceptual connection between Tradition and Approach. You could also let
        Approaches leak through into the character-side rules by giving a +1 bonus to
        Nature or Profession when someone’s Approach applies to a character-level
        action.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wanted to keep the game within a certain feel or genre, you could
        supply a limited set of Approaches to the players. For instance, if you were
        using Sorc to run a game that’s more Shakespearean in its feel, you might want
        to have “Mischievous” as a Trickery Approach, but remove Looming Realization
        as something that’s more appropriate to Mystery or to horror games.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to change how Approaches function, you’re probably really talking
        about changing how Effects work. See below for more on that. Or perhaps you
        want to create a few rules that orbit around Approaches, the way that Subtle
        Conflicts and the Timescales guideline and suchlike orbit around Conflict. In
        that case, read down farther to the Changing Minor Rules header where you can
        a ranking of different character-level effects.
      </p>
      <p id="existentialism_changes">
        Playing around with the <strong>Existentialism</strong> rules can really
        change the feel of the game universe. To give a quick look at each one:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you alter the Rule of Intent, changes to your character that you
          intentionally put into place might render your character unplayable. For
          instance, you might not be allowed to play a character who trades away their
          entire soul.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you alter the Rule of Force, either you or the GM (or a specific set of
          rules) would be the sole arbiter of whether your character was unplayable –
          or, alternatively, you might have to play even characters who had been changed
          without your intent.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you alter the Rule of Identity, you might not be able to play clones or
          separate instances of your character, depending on exactly how you rewrite
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you alter the Rule of Reversal, a character lost to the Rule of Force might
          never come back into play, depending on exactly what happened. Not only would
          this open up “dead is dead” statements, but it might also be a statement of
          “once mind-controlled, forever lost”, so be careful how you rewrite this
          one.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you alter the Rule of Ontological Inertia, the Approaches of a dead or
          unconscious character might no longer affect the story – or, going the other
          way, you might provide players of dead characters with ways to gain Twists, so
          that they can keep using their Approaches. High-Power-score characters could
          actually be more effective with Twists while they’re dead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Existentialism rules were written to be simple, easy to remember, and
        permissive. The idea was to allow people to play the character they think of
        as theirs for as long as they still consider it to be theirs. Most changes to
        these rules would restrict that in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, these rules are all about what you’re comfortable with someone
        playing. If you want to separate out unconscious from dead, mirror-duplicates
        from biological clones, or the like, this is where you do it. Right now, all
        the game cares about is whether your character is “under your control” versus
        “not under your control”.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Complications and Advantages</strong> are the core of the game. Any
        changes to them will have an impact on the entire rest of the system. If
        you’re a computer person, you could think of making changes to Effects as
        being similar to installing a different operating system. You’ll need to
        double-check everything else to make sure the game as a whole works.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might be interested in altering the levels of Effects, or changing the
        listed Twist ratings. You might want to create a specific list of acceptable
        Effects rather than having the general guidelines. You might even want to
        break up Effects by Theme, as was done during the first edition of SA. All I’m
        going to say here is that I recommend being slow and cautious, being willing
        to change things back if they break down, and talking to your players about
        it. The mantra of the game designer is “playtest, playtest, playtest”.
      </p>
      <h3 id="changing_minor_rules">Changing Minor Rules</h3>
      <p>
        When creating a minor rule, it helps to be able to guess how big of an effect
        that rule will have. Let’s rank the changes that you can make in a
        character-level rule from strongest to weakest.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Adding to a Nature score</li>
        <li>Adding to a Profession or Core Value</li>
        <li>Adding to a Conflict score before multiplication</li>
        <li>Gaining Reserve</li>
        <li>
          A “maybe” boost in the Four Questions, or a time-step on the project rules
        </li>
        <li>Adding to a Conflict score after multiplication</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Clearly, not all of these apply in all situations, so you might combine two or
        even three options to get the exact effects you want. For instance, if you
        feel like a particular circumstance should affect Basic Actions, Rituals, and
        Conflict, you might use a Reserve boost to affect Rituals and Basic Actions,
        and a Conflict score boost to affect that arena.
      </p>
      <p>Here’s the same for player-level rules:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Connections with the Existentialism rules (e.g. the Rule of Force)</li>
        <li>Shifts (boosting Effects one level)</li>
        <li>Decreasing Power</li>
        <li>Reducing Effect costs</li>
        <li>Increasing Import</li>
        <li>Gaining a Twist</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It’s hard to compare player-level and character- level effects, but a rough
        guess puts a single point of Power as equivalent to two points in Natures –
        particularly, your highest Natures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have these scales, let’s put them to work. Here are two examples.
      </p>
      <h3 id="more_powerful_natures">
        Example #1: More Powerful Natures
      </h3>
      <p>
        One question that fans of Sorc (and the genre as a whole) have disagreed on is
        the relative importance of raw magical talent. Let’s say that you would prefer
        that Natures play a larger role in the system than they do right now. How
        could you go about changing that?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You could switch Nature scores to a 10-point scale and leave other items on a
          1-5 scale. This is nice because it makes Natures explicitly and visibly more
          powerful. You’ll need to spend some extra effort splitting the 5-level Nature
          descriptions into 10, but that’s just tedious work, not difficult work. You’ll
          also need to adjust how Import is calculated.
        </li>
        <li>
          You could change the Conflict equation from Nature * (CV + Profession) to (CV
          + Prof) ^ Nature – that is, use Nature score as an exponent instead of a
          multiplier.
        </li>
        <li>
          You could implement the alternative resolution chart in the Optional Rules
          section of Sufficiently Advanced (SA2 page 89), or create one of your own.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These solutions obviously have differing levels of complexity and game-table
        time. None of them are wrong, but chances are one of them will work better for
        your game table. The only way you’ll know is by testing.
      </p>
      <h3 id="leveling_up">Example #2: Leveling Up</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s say that you like “zero to hero” stories and you’d like to make those
        possible within SA. The biggest thing in your way is the main balance: if your
        characters become more powerful, they lose out when it comes to the plot. Here
        are a few ways that you might get around that restriction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Keep the Import/Power balance during character creation. Give out one level of
          a Profession each game session, or allow people to trade in two Profession
          points for a level of a Nature. Don’t worry about Power score any more; it’s
          fixed at whatever the character had initially. This is probably the simplest
          method.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep the balance during character creation, but every 3-4 sessions after that,
          reduce the characters’ effective Power scores by 1 for the purpose of the Bad
          Luck Rule. This will allow the characters to seek out their own means of
          enhancement, or to simply benefit from the extra Twists. You probably wouldn’t
          want to just increase Import – that would only provide extra Twists at the
          beginning of the game. Decreasing Tech allows characters to also gain more
          Twists from Complications. This has the benefit of forcing improvements in
          character power to occur as a part of the story.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the balance out of consideration at character creation. Hand everyone a
          certain number of Nature points and Profession points, and give everyone the
          same Import. As the game goes on, hand out more points. This is probably the
          closest to the standard RPG style of advancement. It would be a good choice
          for a games where the characters are younger, still learning and growing
          substantially. However, this method runs into issues if the characters want to
          enhance themselves via external means. You’ll need to forbid that, which
          doesn’t make a lot of sense in the game world, or find another way to prevent
          it, which might come across as arbitrary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As you can see, each option has its own benefits and drawbacks. None of them
        are right or wrong methods – the question is just which is best for your
        personal game. Only you and your players can answer that. Talking to them is
        the best thing you can do when planning out rules changes like these.

    <section class="chapter" title="Death and Better Fates" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="death_and_better_fates">Death and Better Fates</h2>
      <p>
        Most people are used to a world where death is an ending. Players familiar
        with other RPGs, especially, have seen worlds where killing your enemy
        finishes the threat they posed. That's not the case here. When players realize
        that, they often seek some way to make an ending – some way to incapacitate an
        enemy in a semi-permanent fashion. Cutting off their head and running away
        with it. Dropping a mountain on them. Throwing them into the Red Space. Even
        breaking their immortality and killing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these are Critical Complications. While it's true that Critical
        Complications can be permanent, it's by no means guaranteed that any of them
        are, and the physical ones are particularly temporary in this setting. Anyone
        with Communion 4 or 5 can resurrect people. Mystery and Trickery can peek into
        the Red Space to look for survivors. Physically removing someone from the
        field of play forever is effectively impossible. There's always a way for them
        to come back.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you're already dealing a Critical Complication. Other fates on the
        list of Critical Complications include “All Core Values changed” and “Friends'
        allegiances reversed”. Changing your opponent's Core Values is by far the most
        effective way to end the threat they pose.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's true that you can't inflict those kinds of Complications quickly in this
        game. It's not like Sufficiently Advanced, where Metatech enables high-speed
        social interaction. You could overwrite someone's behavior using curses, but
        people can heal from such assaults, and the damage remains visible to others,
        at least on a psychic level. You could trap them and brainwash them, but
        that's still an assault. The moment your enemy enters Rapport with someone who
        knew them, the injury will be clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The timescale for CV change will not be minutes, but weeks, months, possibly
        years. You'll have opposition from their allies. Once you win, though, the
        change can't just be “fixed” by healing them, because it's not a wound. It's
        not an injury. It's what they truly believe, a new part of their Self-nature,
        and healing makes you want you want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mechanically, this sort of contest is generally done using Communion or Self
        against your opponent's Self or Trickery score. Because Critical Complications
        are difficult to inflict, you may need to wear down your opponent's CVs or
        Natures with a series of contests, planting the seeds of a more permanent
        change.

    <section class="chapter" title="Using the Civilizations" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="using_the_civilizations">Using the Civilizations</h2>
      <p>
        None of the civilizations in Sorcerously Advanced are intended to be mere
        caricatures. Each of them does some good and wonderful things, and some rotten
        things. You can use any of them in a more negative and antagonistic role in
        your game, or in a more sympathetic or positive role. Here are some
        suggestions for how you could emphasize some aspects of them, tone back
        others, and tweak each group for use in your own story.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the_cult">The Cult of the Empty Grave</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: Play up the way they help others. Show them tending
        to those unable to control the Gift. Show them working to reform those who
        hurt them in the past. It doesn't matter who you are; if you come to the Cult
        they'll take care of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: Emphasize the Cult's “greatest generation” problem.
        Their morality is stuck in the low-magic past, with no idea how to handle the
        high-magic present. Alternatively, crank up the alienation factor within their
        own citizenry. Cult members who don't want to be a specific kind of beautiful
        are ostracized, treated like freaks. This becomes problematic long before they
        start expecting it of outsiders.
      </p>
      <h3 id="diadem">Diadem</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: The citizens of Diadem care greatly for their
        families. Show those ties. Show them reaching out for one another and taking
        great risks to preserve their families. Diadem is also able and willing to
        lead, and if there's a coalition of civilizations they're clever and
        well-connected enough to bind it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: It's hard to get away from Diadem's aggressive
        colonization of their neighboring countries. They treat people there like toys
        and their customs like trinkets. Diadem claims to love other cultures, but
        it's the same way a child loves a doll and drops it off a bridge the next day.
        Accentuate the deep divides in their civilization and their economic blackmail
        of sovereign nations. Don't let the characters pass through Diadem cities
        without reminding them that there are servants here in a way that there simply
        aren't elsewhere in the Basin.
      </p>
      <h3 id="geometers">The Geometer's Guild</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: The Guild is a champion of education. They've done
        more than any other civilization to increase the general level of scholarship
        in the Basin. The same goes for their legal code. Portray them as wise and
        clever, aware of the faults in their methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: In the same way that Diadem uses money, the Guild
        uses knowledge to take over nations. Remind players that they're erasing local
        Traditions, and that some knowledge of magic will disappear forever when
        they're done. In addition, men and women are treated very differently by the
        Guild, and they're completely black-and-white about the separation. Have them
        demand that people explain themselves if they're not “acting properly”.
      </p>
      <h3 id="glimmermere">Glimmermere</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: At its best, Glimmermere has unlimited potential
        for growth. They have a love of both truth and wisdom. They're good at both
        improvisation and planning. Really, all you need to do to play up
        Glimmermere's strengths is to paper over its weaknesses. Unfortunately...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: At its worst, Glimmermere falls into in-fighting
        and endless drama and never gets anything done. They ran from the Basin when
        things got hard. Imply that they'll do it again – or even show them starting
        to retreat when danger rears its head. You might also set up a situation where
        a Glimmermere resident is in an abusive relationship and their elders simply
        shrug and say “that's the way of love”, underestimating how bad things are.
      </p>
      <h3 id="golden_aegis">The Golden Ægis</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: The view of honor held by the Ægis is one that
        would be appreciated by most cultures in the Great Basin. They're driven to
        improve the world around them, and to improve themselves as well. To show them
        in a positive light, you just need to give them a little flexibility. If
        they're allowed to learn from their mistakes, the Ægis can do wonders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: Conversely, without that flexibility, the Ægis runs
        easily toward despotism. This sort of Ægis swarms nations and overthrows them
        because they aren't being properly respectful, or don't have the right idea of
        righteousness. In D&amp;D terms, play them as aggressively Lawful and you'll have
        a fine antagonist.
      </p>
      <h3 id="hearth_kin">The Hearth-Kin</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: When others hesitate or wring their hands, have the
        Hearth-Kin step in and act. Show them taking care of others, both individually
        and as a nation. Have them express the change of heart they had about leaving
        the Basin and their willingness to learn about the way it is now. The
        Hearth-Kin also understand nuance well, which makes them a good mediating
        factor for some of the more extremist civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: The imperative to get out there and do something
        can really blow up in your face when you do the wrong thing – especially if
        five hundred of you all get together to do it. Play up Hearth-Kin's ignorance
        of the general state of affairs in the Basin. Have them blunder into other
        civilizations' efforts and ruin years of planning. Make them a bunch of nosy,
        ignorant busybodies who barge in and explain what the characters are
        supposedly doing wrong. Then have them fail to come to a decision as to how to
        fix it as it falls down around their heads. If you really want a cherry on top
        of this, have them ignore anyone who doesn't have children because they
        obviously don't know anything about anything.
      </p>
      <h3 id="nova_commonwealth">Nova Commonwealth</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: If there's any civilization that has a place for
        anyone, no matter how odd, it's Nova. Emphasize their responsibility, their
        commitment to avoiding harm, and the Million Ways, and you should have a
        pretty solid protagonist/ally civilization here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: Don't just show the more extreme cults – those make
        great villains in any game regardless of how you want the Commonwealth as a
        whole to look. Instead, make Nova's sense of responsibility less kind and more
        callous. Show how the mainstream allows extremists to continue with what
        they're doing because they're “not really hurting anyone...” except for the
        people who “should have known better” or “should have been able to take care
        of themselves”. A negatively portrayed Nova can have a real “blame the victim”
        mentality.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the_sovereigns">The Sovereigns of Hell</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: Sometimes you need a friend who doesn't give a
        flying fuck what anyone else says. Someone who will happily scare the
        daylights out of your bully, or help you realize that anyone who gives you
        shit is nothing compared to you. Sovereigns are rarely nice, but they can take
        a metaphorical machete to your self-doubt and leave you stronger afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: Let's point out things beyond the obvious “what if
        the demons are taking control” and “what if they turn out to be just as bad”
        scenarios. The Sovereigns have been caught in a cycle of abuse, passing down
        what was done to them. If they're not just having trouble changing, but are
        unwilling to try, that casts them in a more sinister light. They also have
        issues with not being able to let go of things. Portray them as a nation of
        revenge-junkies who use positions of power to step on those who laughed at
        them.
      </p>
      <h3 id="those_above_the_sky">Those Above the Sky</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: Those Above are very good at seeing opportunities
        and capitalizing on them. If you give them a bit of compassion they could make
        a very good ally for many civilizations, even helping smaller nations develop
        and become more self-sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: That compassion? Toss it. Play Those Above as
        hardline money-grubbers who'll put you in the worst spot they possibly can.
        Play up their fragile competitive nature while you're at it. Have them brag
        and boast about their superior positions, then go running to you for help when
        things fail... because running to their “friends” in their own civilization
        would just put them further in debt, and they think they can manipulate you
        into a better deal.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the_unroyal">The Unroyal</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: There's a lot of potential good in the Unroyal.
        They could make an excellent sponsor for a group of characters if you don't
        want to have them working for the Archive (or if the team decides to leave the
        Archive for some reason). Give the Unroyal the wisdom of their experiences and
        a network of supporters in other civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: The Unroyal are, to borrow a phrase, single-issue
        voters. “No tyrants” is a great issue to vote along... so long as they can
        clearly discern who is and isn't a tyrant. A more extremist Unroyal wouldn't
        get along with any civilizations with top-down leadership, including not just
        the Sovereigns, the Guild, and Diadem, but the Ægis and the Cult as well. A
        more extremist Unroyal might also start “exfiltrating” people who didn’t want
        to be removed in the first place.
      </p>
      <h3 id="the_worldbuilders">The Worldbuilders</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: The feeling of togetherness in Worldbuilder cities
        is contagious. Accentuate that sense of community. Have individual
        Worldbuilders reach out to others, to be friends and allies or just as a
        check-in. Have them arrange parties and gatherings. As a civilization, they're
        also an interesting way for sedentary old spirits to take on a new life and
        move up their social ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: It doesn't take much to see that the Worldbuilders,
        both as a civilization and as individuals, need to learn to take no for an
        answer. There are many, many places this could turn foul. In addition, it's
        not hard to play up their dishonesty. The Worldbuilders lie as a matter of
        course when it comes to their time-shifting activities. Odds are good they're
        lying (to others and to their own citizens) about a lot more.
      </p>
      <h3 id="archive">Bonus entry: The Archive</h3>
      <p>
        We won't present every Society, but the Archive is so important to this game's
        default scenario that it's worth taking a few extra paragraphs to talk about
        them. Every organization in this game is a mix of positive and negative, and
        the Archive is no exception.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Positive</strong>: They pursue knowledge. They help to arbitrate
        disputes. They work together in a diverse community that values wisdom and
        truth. The Archive's neutrality helps them help others to reach consensus and
        avoid destroying the relics that might bring a new age of enlightenment to
        their world. Truly, the light of Aion shines upon them. The Archive is already
        shown in a positive light, you just need to have them be willing to take on
        their more negative aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Negative</strong>: The Archive, as a group, are not good listeners.
        They don't cooperate well with other authorities. They're taking their own
        interpretations of the past and encoding those into Universal Repositories for
        all future time. Some of them are even the tomb-robbers and king-makers
        they're accused of being.

      <h2 id="allies_and_enemies">Allies and Enemies</h2>
      <p>
        While there are (currently) no formally declared wars between the
        civilizations, there are certainly some who have it out for one another.
        Here’s a rundown. There’s a diagram of this below to help you
        remember things.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Civ_Chart.png" alt="Civilization chart as described below." />
        <figcaption>
          The Cult, Nova, the Geometers, and Those Above are allied. The Sovereigns'
          only ally is the Worldbuilders. Glimmermere and Diadem are allied. The
          Unroyal, the Aegis, and the Hearth-Kin are allied. The Sovereigns' enemies
          are Nova, the Unroyal, and the Ægis. Diadem's enemies are Those Above, the
          Worldbuilders, and the Unroyal. The Worldbuilders and Glimmermere are
          enemies.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>


      <h3 id="economic_conflicts">Economic Conflicts</h3>
      <p>
        Diadem, Those Above the Sky, and the Worldbuilders are the economic
        powerhouses of this setting. Diadem trades in reagents, talent (including
        labor), and carefully aspected flow. Those Above trade in vast amounts of
        flow. The Worldbuilders are reaching the point where they’re going to be able
        to trade in territory – if they even choose to trade rather than simply
        holding it. All three groups trade extensively with each other, but they’re
        always seeking short-term and long-term advantages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nova Commonwealth’s potential economic power is immense, but they’re not very
        organized as a civilization. On matters of measures and terminology they drive
        the standards, but in the economic arena they barely make a ripple.
      </p>
      <h3 id="economic_alliances">Economic Alliances</h3>
      <p>
        Diadem’s main ally is Glimmermere, for their artistic talent. Those Above work
        with multiple Nova cults and have the Geometer’s Guild as their largest
        customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Worldbuilders have been building alliances with the Sovereigns,
        who do not intend to live in the Basin in the future.
      </p>
      <h3 id="philosophical_conflicts">Philosophical Conflicts</h3>
      <p>
        The Unroyal stand squarely opposed to Diadem, and the two groups are in a de
        facto war. Diadem is so large and rich that the Unroyal have barely made a
        dent, but Diadem is also very family-oriented, and some Unroyal factions have
        “liberated” children from abusive parents or dangerous situations. Diadem
        pulls on Glimmermere’s Carry the Thread CV to motivate them as a buffer
        against the Unroyal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly every civilization has ethical concerns about the Sovereigns, with the
        exception of Those Above, who consider it none of their business. The Ægis are
        particularly conflicted in this area. On the one hand, the Sovereigns are
        winning a war against a demon army that tormented their ancestors for
        centuries. On the other hand... literally everything else about what they’re
        doing. The Sovereigns, of course, resent the interference and the
        implications, and the Ægis are rarely welcome in Sovereign territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many arguments between the Ægis, Unroyal, and Hearth-kin over what
        the right choice is in any particular situation. The Unroyal would rather not
        find themselves on the same side as the autocratic Ægis, but they can’t afford
        to lose their support. The Hearth-kin often find themselves acting as
        peacemakers between the two groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Glimmermere and the Worldbuilders are opposed, not because of any ethical
        mismatch, but because the Worldbuilders seek to metroform the entire Basin and
        Glimmermere is aghast at the vast potential loss of natural beauty.
      </p>
      <h3 id="philosophical_alliances">Philosophical Alliances</h3>
      <p>
        Nova and the Geometer’s Guild are generally in agreement that the bounds of
        magic should be stretched and expanded. They frequently trade expertise and
        publish in each other’s journals. Not that the Guild wants to be as crazy as
        Nova, or that Nova wants to be as boring as the Guild, of course. Perish the
        thought. They have a classic experimenter/theoretician relationship, with Nova
        willing to risk life and limb in their experiments and the Guild taking up the
        job of stitching together experimental results into workable theories.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Unroyal and the Hearth-Kin are both outsiders who returned to the Basin.
        While they don’t see eye-to-eye on everything, and the Unroyal wish the
        Hearth-Kin had made up their minds a little faster, they’re united in the idea
        that the world needs a lot of help.
      </p>
      <h3 id="other_relationships">Other Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        There are a lot of small patches of common ground in the Basin’s philosophies.
        The Guild and the Cult both respect tradition. The Unroyal and the Ægis are
        both proactive. The Diadem and Those Above both believe in not just taking
        responsibility but seizing it. These don’t form the basis of major alliances,
        but they do make for greater respect and stronger friendships between
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, each civilization has a reason to be in the others’ space. Nova’s
        research teams, Diadem’s merchants, Glimmermere’s traveling artists, the Ægis’
        observers, and more all travel between civilizations regularly – all of them
        rely on a tolerant environment that’s currently poised to explode.
      </p>

    <section class="chapter" title="Bodies and Selves" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="bodies_and_selves">Bodies and Selves</h2>
      <p>
        In our own world, our bodies are things that we have relatively little control
        over. It’s hard to change our weight, let alone our facial features, our
        angles and curves, or the color of our skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this game, that’s not the case. The art of Becoming makes the bodies of the
        Basin’s inhabitants reflect the person they want to be, and the way they want
        to be seen. If you know someone’s culture you can make a very good guess as to
        what their chosen physicality says about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn’t mean that the villains of your game are going to be growing
        mustaches to make Snidely Whiplash jealous. A: No one thinks of themselves as
        the villain (some overdramatic Sovereigns aside), and B: The Trickery-nature
        exists. But as the GM, you have explicit permission from me to intentionally
        make your NPCs look like they feel. A shy person may become small. A child who
        was pushed around may grow up much larger than their parents. A Diadem
        resident who meets someone from Glimmermere and dreams of running off to join
        them may slowly start looking like that person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Culture makes a big difference. For example, in the Guild, anyone can be seen
        as intelligent, so someone whose identity revolves around feeling smart could
        look like anyone. In Diadem, though, outsiders are seen as unsophisticated, so
        someone who values being smart will start looking more like they’re from the
        merchant houses. This can be true even if they <strong>resent</strong> the
        merchant houses! Culture is the sea we swim in. Its currents sometimes pull
        our minds in ways we don’t enjoy, and it can take years or decades to put
        aside old thought patterns.
      </p>

      <h3 id="becoming_and_erasure">Becoming and Erasure</h3>
      <p>
        As with many aspects of magic, the impact of Becoming is tightly coupled to
        culture. This is particularly important if you’re born in a way (or change in
        a way) that your culture rejects, because Becoming works on both a conscious
        and subconscious level.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our world, many people are told, “It would be better if you changed”, both
        by individuals and by their cultures as a whole. Their own minds and hearts
        know differently: “But this is who I am.” Those kinds of frictions give rise
        to subcultures and counter-cultures. Trans people, homosexual people, deaf
        people, members of religious minorities, and more each have their own styles
        and traditions and in-jokes within the larger culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s true in the Great Basin as well, but with Becoming in the mix, the
        effects of cultural pressure and individual choice are both stronger. Bodies
        and minds can shift; one <strong>can</strong> actually change, and the social
        pressure to conform battles against self-identity in a way that carries just
        as much weight as it does in our world.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn’t mean that identity is meaningless in this game! Far from it. When
        you are different from what your civilization approves of, identity is
        something you have to fight for. Battling cultural erasure is just as
        important in the Great Basin as it is in our world.
      </p>
      <p>
        True Speech is another case where magic has the potential to erase culture.
        Over time, widespread Travel dilutes <a href="Cultures.xhtml#residuum">linguistic residuum</a>, and it
        fades into memory. Language is a central part of real-world culture. In the
        Basin, the linguistic parts of culture seem likely to disappear some day
        simply because True Speech is so convenient. It feels painful, and potentially
        painfully close to real-world cultural erasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions were present in SA to a lesser extent. While Old-worlder
        cultures in SA were gradually left behind, in this game, magic utterly
        transformed every profession in the world, all at once. There are many pieces
        of culture that will not survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t know how to handle these questions with the care and experience they
        need, but I do at least know how to notice them and bring them up. If you’re a
        GM or player interacting with these kinds of issues in real life, I’d love to
        hear whether and how you handle such questions in your own game.

    <section class="chapter" title="Graphical Motifs" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="graphical_motifs">Graphical Motifs</h2>
      <p>
        There are two major graphical motifs in Sorcerously Advanced: speedpainting
        and the color purple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Purple was chosen because it’s often associated with magic, from amethyst
        crystals to wizard’s robes. Filmmakers sometimes use purple lighting to
        indicate an otherworldly situation. Part of this may be because it’s a rare
        color in nature. It immediately draws the attention and sticks out as unusual.
        Purple is also associated with royalty, and the nature of power (both mystical
        and political) is a central theme for this game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speedpainting is, in some ways, modern impressionism. It’s driven as much by
        emotion and implication as by technical, representational skill. The feel of
        the work is central, with essence valued over details. Speedpainting demands
        that artists drive toward the most powerful and effective expression of their
        subject. This gets to the heart of magic in Sorcerously Advanced: emotional
        connections between technical skill, the self as it is created through one’s
        own actions, and the unfetterable truth of the-world-as-it-is.

    <section class="chapter" title="Crossover Shenanigans" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="crossover_shenanigans">Crossover Shenanigans</h2>
      <p>
        Who doesn’t like a good crossover? This section is for folks who want to run a
        game where characters from SA2 have to deal with the Great Basin, or where the
        Patent Office’s universe is part of the Kaleidoscope.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’d like to bring characters from Sorc into SA2 or vice versa, they
        should be able to interact fairly easily using the rules from their own games.
        The numbers in SA2 and Sorc are essentially identical. You’ll have to make
        some decisions about the reliability of technology and the availability of
        flow in a new universe, but at least the game mechanics won’t be fighting
        against your decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to make <strong>hybrid</strong> characters, that’s where the fun
        really gets started. Maybe you want to play a sentient nanotech bloom powered
        by alchemy. Maybe your Earthpower enhancements have effectively given you a
        Biotech score. Here’s how to handle that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some terminology first: Nature scores and Capabilities are both “attributes”.
        Power is a more general term than Tech, so we’re going to keep the Power score
        instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s a certain core of attributes that you need to have in order to have a
        playable character. The absolute minimum is this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Self</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That’s it. With just the Self-nature, your character can have opinions, defend
        them, and change them when necessary, and that’s the base minimum. Also,
        because of what the Self-nature encompasses in this game, you’re a
        shapeshifter who does soul magic. You can participate in conflicts centered
        around your physical body, your soul, and protecting or acting in accord with
        your beliefs. You can’t really change someone else’s beliefs with a conflict,
        nor are you going to be solving mysteries or planning out social events. In
        physical conflicts, you’re limited to the effectiveness you can get from
        shapeshifting. A lot of Professions are going to be out of your reach, but
        anything that could be instinct-driven is ok. Your Power score is equal to
        your Self rating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since characters with just Self are fairly limited and may be difficult to
        play, you probably want this as a core instead:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One “thinking” attribute: Cognitech, Mystery, or Trickery.</li>
        <li>One “feeling” attribute: Metatech or Communion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have only attributes from that list, you’re an AI, an immaterial
        spirit, or something else bodiless. Take the appropriate Neuroform and Earthly
        Form descriptors to represent what you are. You can learn any Profession,
        though you might need to borrow a body to get any use from some of them.
        Adding physical attributes gets you a physical body, with all the benefits and
        vulnerabilities that come with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you start adding more attributes to your core, not only do you get a
        physical body, but the calculation for your Power score changes slightly.
        Start with the <a href="CharGen.xhtml#import">Power calculation used in this book</a> rather than the one in
        SA2. When you pick up your 7th attribute, average your first
        <strong>three</strong> attributes instead of the first two. When you pick up
        your tenth attribute, average the first <strong>four</strong>, you magitech
        monstrosity you. If your game does not include the <a href="Rules.xhtml#worst_enemy">Worst Enemy Rule</a>
        in this book but doesn’t exist in SA2), subtract 1 from all Power scores for
        no other reason than game balance.
