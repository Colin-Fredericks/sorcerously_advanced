    <h1 id="chargen" class="title">Character Creation</h1>

    <p>
      Each player in Sorcerously Advanced takes on the role of a single
      character, speaking and making important decisions based on that
      character’s personality. Your character will be your window on the game
      world. Your choices while creating and playing your character will have
      repercussions that shape that character’s story.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating a character can be done very quickly if you have a strong
      concept in mind. However, the first time you play it may take some time
      to decide what you want to play. You should consult with your GM to see
      whether there are any restrictions on the sorts of characters available
      in this game. It may also help to converse with your fellow players and
      see whether there are any notable gaps in the team.
    </p>

    <p>To create a character, follow this checklist:</p>

    <section class="subchapter" title="0. Concept" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="concept">0. Character Concept</h2>

      <p>
        Your character in Sorcerously Advanced works with the Archive, unless
        your GM is running a different sort of game. The Archive employs a wide
        variety of people with various skills, and you might be:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>An archaeologist, seeking out ancient ruins and interpreting the
          materials found therein.</li>
        <li>An envoy, talking with the local leadership to obtain access to new
          ruins and finds.</li>
        <li>A theoretician, trying to fit new discoveries into your theories about
          flow and magic.</li>
        <li>A scout, watching out for danger in the ruins and surrounding lands.</li>
        <li>A soldier or bodyguard, making sure that everyone makes it safely
          through the mission.</li>
        <li>A double agent, working for the Archive while reporting on them to
          another employer.</li>
        <li>A would-be tomb robber, looking to grab something important for
          yourself.</li>
        <li>A local expert, filling any of the roles above and more, with
          specialized knowledge of the area and perhaps an interest in joining the
          Archive full-time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sorcerously Advanced is a game where a character’s body can be shaped to
        match their desires and beliefs. If you’re playing a bodyguard, you
        might want a powerful body with metallic scales and an intimidating
        stare. If you want to become a dragon, you can. Shapeshifting exists in
        this world, and is even common. If you are a dig supervisor, it might be
        nice to have dozens of bodies that share the same mind and soul. Even if
        your character was born into a single body, that’s a change your
        character can choose to make. It makes perfect sense to play a character
        whose body matches their chosen path in life.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you play more and become more experienced, you might want to take on
        more unusual or nuanced roles. Some characters keep using bodies that
        are unsuited to their jobs, for all kinds of reasons. Talking with the
        GM and other players will help you refine what you want to play and
        ensure that the group “fits together” more effectively. Teams often have
        a wide range of skills and backgrounds.
      </p>

      <aside title="Notes for  Experienced Gamers">
        <h3>Two Notes for Experienced Gamers</h3>

        <p>
          First note: Don’t worry about creating a “good build” for your
          character. Every character, from a massive angelic warrior to the
          Basin’s greatest physician to an 8-year-old farmboy, is an effective
          character in this game.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second note: Characters in Sorcerously Advanced typically do not improve
          their skills and capabilities as the game goes on. Play the character
          you want to play from the beginning, and don’t feel like you need to
          start out small.
        </p>
      </aside>

    </section>

    <section class="subchapter" title="1. Civilization" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="civ">1. Civilization</h2>

      <p>
        Each character comes from a particular Civilization. In game terms, a
        Civilization passes on a set of beliefs to each of its citizens. More
        fundamentally, it is your character’s home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eleven different <a href="Cultures.xhtml">Civilizations</a> are
        described in this book. You can find a summary list of them
        <a href="#communities">below</a>. Many of them
        are large – they cover an entire continent, or have equivalent
        populations spread throughout thousands of city-states across reality.
        Some are much smaller.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you pick an existing Civilization, write down its Core Values on your
        character sheet. If you rank both of them as zero, you no longer care
        for your home civilization – see Characters Without a Home below.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should also take this opportunity to name your character. Each
        civilization has a suggested naming convention in its description.
        Thanks to the effects of translation magic, character names are made up
        of real words instead of strings of random syllables.
      </p>

      <p>
        If none of the listed Civilizations appeal to you, you can choose to
        come from a more distant location. See the guidelines
        <a href="#invent_civ">below</a> for creating your own Civilization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you have your Civilization you may add a Society if you like. If
        you are not part of a Society, move on to your Earthly Form.
      </p>

      <aside title="Characters Without a Home">
        <h3 id="char_without_home">Characters Without a Home</h3>

        <p>
          It is possible to play characters who have rejected their home
          Civilizations, or even rejected the very concept of civilization. Such
          people are fairly rare in the Great Basin, but not unheard-of.
        </p>

        <p>
          To accomplish this in game terms, simply drop the Core Values for your
          Civilization and replace them with whatever CVs you like. You retain one
          Shift (see below), but can use it in whatever sort of situation you
          like.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <aside title="Dual Citizenship">
        <h3 id="dual_citizenship">Dual Citizenship</h3>

        <p>
          It is theoretically possible to start the game with your character
          really and truly belonging to two cultures at once, believing in and
          drawing strength from both. Certain combinations are unlikely, but few
          are totally impossible. After all, human beings fill their minds with
          contradictions all the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Characters with dual citizenship should have all the Core Values
          required by both Civilizations, with a nonzero rating in each. They gain
          a third Shift (see below), which can be used for either civilization. If
          the ratings of the appropriate Core Values drop to zero, you lose that
          extra Shift. It can be difficult maintaining two separate loyalties.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <h3 id="shifts">Shifts</h3>

      <p>
        Being part of a civilization ties you into their stories. To represent
        this in game terms, you get two Shifts to use in each game session. In
        situations that connect with your civilization or its Core Values you
        can spend a Shift to increase or decrease any Complication or Advantage
        that applies to your character by one step. You’ll learn more about
        <a href="Rules.xhtml#complications">Complications and Advantages</a> later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shifts can be used regardless of how the Complication or Advantage is
        created. You can spend more than one at a time if you like. Unspent
        Shifts do not carry over to the next game session. Note that Shifts are
        available to both player characters and NPCs.
      </p>

      <h3 id="invent_civ">Inventing a Civilization</h3>

      <p>
        Game Masters who want to allow for more player-driven creativity might
        tell you to create your own civilization for your character. This is an
        opportunity for you to create and define a piece of the game world. In
        addition, players who want to portray someone from the Unruly Lands or
        from beyond the local area of the Basin can use these guidelines to
        describe their home nation and the way it impacts them.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you invent your own Civilization, take a few moments to consider your
        character’s home world and other worlds in that civilization. Each
        player should name the character’s Civilization and write down answers
        to these questions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>What is your Civilization best known for?</li>
        <li>How magically and technologically advanced is your Civilization, and how
          obvious is that advancement to outsiders?</li>
        <li>In what ways does your Civilization interact with others?</li>
        <li>What does your Civilization care about most?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are many other questions to consider as the game progresses. This
        sort of exercise can easily take all night. Skim the surface for right
        now. You will have the opportunity to elaborate on your Civilization as
        the game progresses. Those Civilizations will become more detailed
        through play, with Twists and cutscenes defining how they work and
        interact later on.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you have time, you should consider: How does your Civilization deal
        with such things as immortality, poverty, nonhuman life, and personal
        freedoms? What religions are prevalent? What does the civilization call
        itself, and what do outsiders call it? Is it mostly located in one
        particular part of the Great Basin, or is it spread across many
        locations? How does this culture feel about other Civilizations and
        Societies?
      </p>

      <p>
        You should pick up to three of your <a href="CharGen.xhtml#cvs">Core Values</a> that link
        you to your Civilization. Other individuals in your Civilization will
        share those values to some extent. Even characters who sprung full-grown
        into the world and have just come into existence are typically graced
        with someone else’s point of view and basic morals.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may also choose to state that your
        <a href="CharGen.xhtml#earthlyform">Earthly Form</a> is typical
        for those in your Civilization, or to have your character be considered
        unusual.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you create your own Civilization, you will probably
        <a href="#invent_trad">create your own Tradition</a> as well.
      </p>

      <aside title="Civilizations and Traditions">
        <h3 id="civtrad">Civilizations and Traditions</h3>

        <p>
          Not all civilizations teach all types of magic, but this should
          not restrict you as you create your character. It is possible for
          any character to learn any Tradition. Most people know the Traditions
          of their own civilization, but some people study abroad, abandon
          their upbringing, learn magic on their own, or invent their own
          unique approach or sorcery.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is still worth considering the Traditions of your home
          Civilization as you create your character, but more for
          story purposes than for game-mechanics reasons.
        </p>
      </aside>

    </section>

    <section class="subchapter" title="2. Society" epub:type="chapter">
      <h2 id="society">2. Society</h2>

      <p>
        Some characters belong to a Society. Societies are groups that spread
        across multiple civilizations, with members on many different
        continents. You can find a quick list below, or jump to
        the <a href="Cultures.xhtml#societies">Society</a> section.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every Society is different. Some Societies are well-organized groups:
        you might be part of a secret society that frees lost souls, or an
        organized criminal cartel that spreads across multiple worlds. Others
        are catch-all descriptions for people who typically share a Core Value:
        medical caregivers, people in high society, or people who worship a
        particular deity. Some Societies have membership numbering in the
        millions, but others have only a few thousand members.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you choose to be part of a Society, write that Society’s Core Value
        on your list of CVs. When that CV is rated at 3 or higher, you receive
        the Society’s special benefit. If it drops below 3, you lose the
        benefit. You will eventually lose membership in the Society if you lose
        the CV entirely.
      </p>

      <aside title="Multiple Societies">
        <h3>Multiple Societies</h3>

        <p>
          It is possible to be part of more than one Society. In game terms all
          you need to do is have the appropriate CVs rated at 3 or higher.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of your character’s free time and freedom of action, however,
          joining multiple Societies is likely to be draining. Not only do you
          have additional passions that will occupy your character’s time, you
          will likely have demands on your schedule from those higher up in your
          Society. Someone who is both a Hospitaler and a Peacewalker (a fairly
          reasonable combination) would be very busy in a conflict zone, with two
          groups each expecting full measures of that character’s time.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <h3>Inventing a Society</h3>

      <p>
        You may wish to invent a Society for your character. Even in games where
        the GM has required that you choose from a restricted list of
        Civilizations, you should feel free to ask about creating your own
        Society – there are many more Societies than Civilizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you create a unique Society for your character, consider how this
        Society would fit into multiple different Civilizations. Think about how
        it is seen by outsiders, and how its members view each other. What
        rituals or beliefs do they have? Are there other Societies who are their
        rivals? You don’t need to describe everything right away, but you should
        build up more detail as time goes on, to give you a better grasp on your
        character.
      </p>

      <p>
        Society benefits are typically focused on the skills that a member of
        that society needs. They might offer a
        <a href="Rules.xhtml#comp_adv">competitive advantage</a>
        in a particular Profession, an extra point of Reserve that can be
        used with a particular Profession, or a special Profession that only
        members of that Society can have. This special Profession should be
        broader than usual, covering the same ground as two standard
        Professions.
      </p>

        <h3 id="communities">Communities of the Great Basin</h3>

        <p>
          This section gives a list of the civilizations and societies that can be
          found in the game’s standard setting, along with their core values and
          magical Traditions. Use this section to help pick your character’s
          civilization and, optionally, a society.

        <h2 id="earthlyform">3. Optional: Earthly Form</h2>

        <p>
          Your character’s Earthly Form is an optional way to describe their body,
          especially as it relates to magical forces. It is a broad toolbox used to
          describe a wide variety of body types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choose one and only one item from each row below. The left-most item (in bold)
          is the “default” that fits the majority of sentients.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Physical</strong> • Energy Being • Phased Out</li>
          <li><strong>Balanced</strong> • Aspected • Flow Parasite</li>
          <li><strong>Single</strong> • Swarm</li>
          <li><strong>Born</strong> • Sprung Full-Grown • Constructed</li>
          <li><strong>Embodied</strong> • Possessing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Having all of your choices be the default is referred to as having a
          “conventional” form.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose something other than the default, when your body inconveniences
          you or prevents you from taking an action, you gain Twists as per the
          <a href="Rules.xhtml#bad_luck">Bad Luck Rule</a>. If you're not sure where you belong (is a fire elemental
          physical or an energy being?), you should just decide which category you
          prefer and stick with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Physical</strong> beings have bodies made of matter, whether that's
          flesh and blood or the clay of an automaton. <strong>Energy</strong>
          <strong>Beings</strong> are made of fire, lightning, or some other sort of
          very active material. They are immune to their own element, but cannot
          necessarily pass through walls. Beings who are <strong>Phased Out</strong> can float and move through physical materials. They're
          immune to purely physical attacks, but mental or energy attacks will still
          harm them. Ghosts and spirits are the most common members of this category.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most beings are <strong>Balanced</strong> with respect to flow aspects. They
          can use any sort of flow, though some (like death flow) present challenges to
          safe handling. <strong>Aspected</strong> beings generate and resonate with one
          specific <a href="Magic.xhtml#flow">aspect of flow</a>. <strong>Flow
            Parasites</strong> are beings who do not generate their own flow at
          all, and must consume it to stay alive. If they have a number of willing
          friends who will donate their own, or if they live on a ley line, they're
          perfectly safe. Otherwise, they slowly starve, becoming more and more
          desperate for a meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Single</strong> beings have just one body, as opposed to
          <strong>Swarms</strong> who have more than one and are in full control of all
          of them. The more bodies you have, the less you can accomplish with each
          individual one, though Twists can help to mitigate this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most beings were <strong>Born</strong> as children and grew up to be adults.
          Some, however, <strong>Sprang Full-Grown</strong>
          from the minds of gods or from unusual conditions in the Basin (or elsewhere).
          Others were <strong>Constructed</strong>, built by someone for a particular
          purpose, from manual labor to companionship. Beings in the two later
          categories often have significant blind spots in their understanding of the
          world. They may look like adults, but they might be just a year or two old.
          The more severe the problem is, the more often you are likely to gain Twists
          for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Embodied</strong> beings have a soul that lives within a body (whether
          that body is physical, energy, or phased out).
          <strong>Possessing</strong> beings, on the other hand, are nothing but a soul,
          with no bodily identity of their own. If they wish to interact with the world
          of matter and energy, they must share a body with a willing host or have a
          custom body constructed especially for them.

      <section class="subchapter" title="4. Core Values" epub:type="chapter">
        <h2 id="cvs">4. Core Values</h2>

        <p>
          Core Values describe what your character believes in and strives toward.
          They are the basis of your motivation. Core Values also hold
          Civilizations and Societies together, giving them something to rally
          around.
        </p>

        <p>
          Core Values (CVs) are most often directives about how to live your life:
          Love Openly, Raise Them Right, Preserve Tradition, and so forth. More
          rarely, they can be a person or a place. They are guidelines not only
          for you as a player, but for your character as well: most characters
          recognize their own Core Values and will be able to eloquently (or at
          least stubbornly) defend them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each Core Value is rated from 1-5, based on the depth of your
          character’s convictions:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>I am not completely convinced.</li>
          <li>I will argue for this belief.</li>
          <li>I will take action for this belief.</li>
          <li>I will suffer for this belief.</li>
          <li>I am obsessed. I will die for this belief.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Your character will have four Core Values at the start of the game. One
          will be the Self-Preservation CV that all characters start with. Two
          will be inherited from your Civilization. One is a free choice you make
          when creating the character. (You can use this to qualify for a
          <a href="CharGen.xhtml#society">Society</a>
          if you wish.) In addition, you will have a fifth CV that is
          initially left blank.
        </p>

        <h3>Choosing and Rating Core Values</h3>

        <p>
          When choosing a Core Value you can select literally any suitable concept
          or cause. These are normally encapsulated in a single word or short
          phrase. A list of examples can be found <a href="#sample_cvs">below</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since different characters can interpret the same CV differently, you
          might want to write down a longer description of your CV, so that your
          GM can better understand your character’s motivation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Complex actions or philosophies are generally not suitable Core Values.
          “War” is a bad choice; that’s an action, not an ideal. Make it more
          specific: “The Glory of Battle” or “War Brings Peace.” Most religions
          are poor choices because there are too many facets to them. You should
          choose specific aspects of a religion instead of the faith as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
          You probably also want to pick Core Values that are active rather than
          defensive, and specific rather than vague. For instance, “You can’t
          order me around” isn’t great. Instead, consider CVs like “Everyone
          Deserves Self-Determination” or “Secure Your Privacy”. These would not
          only reveal more about why and how you can’t be ordered around, but will
          also drive your character into the action.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may select whatever rating you like for your Core Values. High
          scores are as much a handicap as an advantage. You may even rate a CV at
          zero to indicate something that you were taught to believe but have
          rejected. High Core Values are typically associated with religious
          zealots. However, this need not be true. People with Charity as a
          highly-ranked Core Value are not required to live in the gutter after
          giving all their possessions away, and are certainly under no compulsion
          to steal from the rich to give to the poor (though they might quietly
          approve of such things). It is possible to have very strong beliefs and
          never once become violent because of them. Sadly, many people don’t see
          it that way.
        </p>

        <h3>Self-Preservation</h3>

        <p>
          All characters receive a CV entitled “Self- Preservation” at 4 for free.
          You may rename this to “Enormous Ego,” “Fight Like A Cornered Rat,” or
          whatever you like in order to fit your character better. The general
          gist of this CV is that you care about your own survival. You may alter
          the value of this CV with GM approval.
        </p>

        <h3>The Open CV</h3>

        <p>
          One of your Core Values is blank at the beginning of the game. You may
          choose this CV and set its rating at any time. Once chosen, it is
          treated like a normal Core Value and cannot be changed again without
          effort or conflict.
        </p>

        <p>
          You might use this to pull a “surprise reveal” for your character, such
          as being part of a Society or working for a particular faction. It’s
          good to consider such things well in advance. If you reveal a CV that is
          contradicted by your character’s past actions, it makes your character
          less believable. Alternatively, you might simply use this CV as a part
          of your character’s normal development through the story. Difficult
          situations can make us realize what we believe. The phrase, “It’s
          character- building,” is not just rhetoric.
        </p>

        <h3>The Effects of Core Values</h3>

        <p>
          When in a <a href="Rules.xhtml#conflict">conflict</a>, your CVs improve your effectiveness as long as you
          are acting in accordance with them. You may use only the highest
          relevant CV; they do not add together.
        </p>

        <p>
          When people try to convince you to take a particular action that aligns
          well with one of your Core Values and you attempt to resist, you are at
          a substantial disadvantage. Add your own CV score to your opponent’s
          Profession rating. You might or might not be able add your
          Self-Preservation CV.
        </p>

        <aside title="Conflicting CVs">

          <h3>Conflicting CVs</h3>

          <p>
            It’s ok to have two characters in the same groups whose CVs are in
            conflict. If they debate those CVs with each other, so much the
            better. This is an intended event in Sorcerously Advanced.
          </p>

          <p>
            If their characters come to blows over it, that can also be ok,
            with certain caveats. Not all characters stay with all groups
            forever, and it’s ok for characters to leave a group over a
            significant disagreement. It’s also ok for
            characters to talk over their stances (or actions) and agree to
            set them aside for the sake of a mission – or for friendship.
            It’s even ok to change CVs. Human beings have changes of heart
            sometimes.
          </p>

          <p>
            What’s not ok is to allow an in-character conflict to become a
            conflict between players, or to use the phrase “that’s part of
            my character” to justify being a jerk in the game. No one
            character is so important as to be allowed to ruin
            the group’s fun.
          </p>

        </aside>

        <aside title="Changing Your Mind">

          <h3 id="change_mind">Changing your Mind</h3>

          <p>
            The Self-nature allows characters to change their own Core Values.
            At higher levels, with the aid of the Self-nature, they can change
            very quickly. However, Core Values are the things in which your
            character genuinely believes. Your character wouldn’t normally
            want to change them. You should have a good reason for giving
            up on those things – a major story event that shakes the
            foundations of your character’s beliefs. It’s unlikely that
            you’ll go back after such a change.
          </p>

          <p>
            Changing your Core Values without such aid can be a difficult and lengthy
            process, or it can be the result of a single dramatic event in your
            character’s life. Using Twists and Plots can help to create such events if you
            feel like you need one. Talk such things over with the GM and decide what
            makes the most sense for your character’s personal story.
          </p>

        </aside>

        <aside title="The Core of Character">
          <h3>The Core of Character</h3>

          <p>
            Core Values are the essence of a character, the central core of belief
            around which personality forms. In addition, the Self-nature allows people
            to alter their very being – sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most basic consequence of this is that the rest of your character should
            be shaped by their CVs. Not every facet of your character needs to come
            directly from Core Values, but these facets should at least not contradict
            them. Someone who believes in Peace and Simplicity should not have a high
            War-nature. Someone who believes in Security and Preparedness should be
            familiar with the Samaritan profession.
          </p>

          <p>
            A more subtle consequence is that changing CVs means changing your character
            at a level deeper than just game mechanics. When we see character
            development in a book or movie, we see people changing what they believe in.
            Different priorities come to the fore, and things that once seemed important
            become less so. If you want that sort of story arc for your own character,
            Core Values are almost guaranteed to change in the process.

      <section class="subchapter" title="5. Magical Tradition" epub:type="chapter">
        <h2 id="tradition">5. Magical Tradition</h2>

        <p>
          Simple magic can be done with intent and willpower alone, but a capable
          sorcerer does more than just yearn and hope. Traditions are the
          mechanism by which magical effects are expertly invoked.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traditions are systems of understanding that lead to magical power. All
          Traditions have three components: a Path by which they work their magic,
          a Fount that describes the type of magic they do, and a large set of
          Expressions (or “Arts”) that are specific spells or techniques of magic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each Civilization teaches its citizens one or more Traditions. You
          should select at least one Tradition for your character, probably from
          your character’s Civilization. You are allowed to select more than one –
          as many as you want to keep track of. If your character knows more than
          one Tradition, there is a benefit in flexibility, but there are costs to
          switching between them.
        </p>

        <h3 id="core_exp">Core Expressions</h3>

        <p>
          Select six Expressions for each Tradition you know. These are your Core
          Expressions: the magical arts you’re always prepared to use. You can
          cast spells that aren’t part of your Core Expressions, but
          <a href="Magic.xhtml#pay_magic">it costs you</a>
          a point of Reserve each time. Most of your
          Core Expressions should come from the recommended list for your
          Tradition, but you can swap out one or two of them for magical arts that
          suit your character better.
        </p>

        <p>
          All characters know the
          <a href="Magic.xhtml#expressions_by_type">Universal Expressions</a>.
          You don’t have to select them in your list.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can have the same Expression in your Core list for more than one
          Tradition if you so choose.
        </p>

        <aside>

          <h4 id="change_core_exp">Changing Core Expressions</h4>

          <p>
            Replacing one Core Expression with another take a lot of planning
            and work, as well as a shift in your mindset. This can be done as
            a Minor <a href="Rules.xhtml#rituals">Ritual</a> using the
            Self-nature and any Profession appropriate
            to the new Expression, with a minimum score of 2 in each.
            If you’re strapped for time, you can use Twists instead:
            replacing a Core Expression counts as a Major Advantage
            (you'll learn more about <a href="#twists">Twists</a>
            and <a href="Rules.xhtml#complications">Advantages</a> later on).
          </p>

        </aside>

        <h3 id="switching_traditions">Switching Traditions</h3>

        <p>
          If you know multiple Traditions, you can switch between them by spending
          a point of Reserve.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you switch between Traditions, recalculate your Power and Import as
          per the <a href="#switch_trad">rules in the Import section</a>.
          In addition, the first time you use a new Path
          or a new Fount in a session, pay one Twist. This can’t cost you more
          than 2 Twists per session.
        </p>

        <h3 id="invent_trad">Inventing a Tradition</h3>

        <p>
          Inventing a new Tradition can be as simple as selecting
          a <a href="Magic.xhtml#paths">Path</a>,
          a <a href="Magic.xhtml#founts">Fount</a>, and six Core Expressions.
          These should usually
          come from those listed for the Fount, but exceptions do exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later, you should also consider the doctrines and approaches that shape
          that Tradition. Two Traditions that both follow the path of Belief to
          perform acts of Glory might work in very different ways, and even look
          very different, depending on what sort of beliefs they consider
          important. At character creation, however, all you need are the
          basics.
        </p>

        <aside title="Magic Without Traditions">

          <h3>Magic Without Traditions</h3>

          <p>
            Some characters, especially those who are self-trained or who
            discovered magic late in life, may not have a formalized Tradition
            yet. Until they learn or develop a more cohesive Tradition,
            such characters are limited to Nature scores of 1 or 2 and may
            only use the Universal Expressions.
          </p>

        </aside>

      </section>

      <section class="subchapter" title="6. Natures and Approaches" epub:type="chapter">

        <h2 id="natures">6. Natures and Approaches</h2>

        <p>
          Natures are the core of this game. They describe the powers that
          characters use to affect the world, and the manner in which players
          affect the plot.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are six Natures: <strong>Communion</strong> (connection with other beings),
          <strong>Industry</strong> (building and working), <strong>Mystery</strong> (whether creating or solving
          them), <strong>Self</strong> (understanding one's self and one's soul), <strong>Trickery</strong> (fooling
          people and getting away with it), and <strong>War</strong> (striving to overpower
          others).
        </p>

        <h3>Nature Scores</h3>

        <p>
          Nature scores are numerical ratings that represent the degree to which
          your character embodies certain facets of humanity. You will choose a
          set of Nature scores for each Tradition you have. While using that
          Tradition, you use its Nature scores and Power rating.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nature scores range from 1 to 5. A score of 1 represents an unenhanced
          human with little to no magical prowess. A score of 5 represents someone
          who has broad and deep magical powers within that Nature’s purview.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can set your character’s Nature scores to whatever values you like.
          Higher values lead to a higher Power rating in that Tradition, as per
          the <a href="#import">Import rules</a>. The greater your
          Power score is, the less ability you will have
          to use Twists later on. Your Power score reduces the number of Twists
          you gain in certain circumstances, including at the beginning of new
          play sessions.
        </p>

        <h3>Approaches</h3>

        <p>
          Regardless of their ratings, each of your Natures has an Approach.
          Approaches describe the ways that you as a player can change the plot
          around your character. They can line up with your character’s Nature and
          Core Values, or they can be quite different in feel. There is no number
          associated with an Approach, and they don’t change if you switch
          Traditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          To choose your Approaches, pick an adjective for each Nature that seems
          appropriate to the character. Good Approaches restrict the use of your
          Twists, but not too much. If you dream up a set of situations that are
          related to a particular Nature, your Approach should make it so that you
          can only imagine using it in about half of those situations. Approaches
          that apply all the time are not restrictive enough to be meaningful.
          Approaches that would only be useful about a quarter of the time are
          probably too restrictive to be fun playing.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are not forbidden from having similar Approaches to different
          Natures – for instance, “Always Prepared” is a suitable Approach for
          both Trickery and Mystery, and you could select it for both. However,
          you will probably not get as much benefit from this as you would from
          choosing a more diverse set of Approaches.
        </p>

        <h3 id="twists">Twists</h3>

        <p>
          Finally, each Nature also has a bank of Twists, which you use to
          activate the Approaches. You can bank up to six Twists in each Nature,
          and up to 12 total across all Natures. You spend these Twists to create
          <a href="Rules.xhtml#complications">Complications or Advantages</a>
          that are appropriate to your
          Approach, either in that Nature or an <a href="#adjacent_natures">adjacent</a> one. At the end of a game session you lose any unspent
          Twists, then refill based on your Import.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can gain more Twists by taking Complications, but characters with
          deep Natures gain diminished rewards from their Complications. More
          information can be found under the <a href="Rules.xhtml#bad_luck">Bad Luck Rule</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          All six Natures are described in detail below, with
          suitable Approaches for each. Also listed is a quick overview of the
          Expressions that spring from these Natures. A table indicates which
          abilities are universal to all magi and which require special training.
          You can find more detail on these spells and techniques later on, in the
          <a href="Magic.xhtml">Magic chapter</a>.
        </p>

        <section class="nature" title="Communion">
          <h3 id="communion-nature">Communion</h3>

          <div class="hangright">
            <img src="images/telepathy.svg" alt="" />
          </div>

          <p>Offer • Share • Heal</p>

          <p>
            The Communion-Nature reaches for connection with other creatures, from
            animals to fellow intelligent beings to Aion itself. The stronger one's
            Communion score is, the deeper the connection. Those deep in the
            Communion-nature can share knowledge and power, heal the sick, fit into
            other cultures, and share thoughts with distant allies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Communion is not about gathering information – that falls under Mystery. You
            might use Communion to get someone to open up to you, but it won't let you
            read their mind. The exception is with Core Values, which Communion reveals
            just as accurately as Mystery does. Communion is also not about bending
            people to your will. If you want to show someone a truth and urge them to
            act, that's Communion. If you’d rather browbeat someone until they obey,
            that's War.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Key Expressions:</strong> Dreamshaping, Healing, Hypnopraxis,
            Rapport, Universal Repositories
          </p>

          <p>
            Approaches to Communion typically revolve around how you connect, rather
            than around what you connect with. Some people make friends with a kind and
            easy manner. Others are lovably awkward or endearingly honest. Still others
            draw people into their circles (or their beds) with sheer magnetism.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main tradeoff for Communion’s Approaches is made between loyalty,
            openness and the speed with which one makes a connection. Friendship alone
            may not convince someone to follow you into battle, nor will a brash manner
            encourage people to share their secrets with you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Sample Approaches:</strong> Brash and bold, Calculating,
            Compassionate, Dreamy, Friendly, Instant Insider, Open, Pragmatic,

          <p>Build • Direct • Maintain</p>

          <p>
            The focus of the Industry-Nature is creation and productivity. Whether
            you're calling a cliff up from the ground, raising a castle in a day,
            tilling a hundred fields at once, or speeding the movement of flow through a
            kingdom, you're using Industry. When directed well, it builds wealth,
            repairs homes, and speeds travel. When poorly directed, it causes floods,
            resource shortages, and Null Zones.
          </p>

          <p>
            Industry normally builds, but it can also destroy. When attacking an
            individual or a nation, use War. When seeking to tear down a shrine or chop
            down a forest, Industry is just as valid. When it comes to direct harm, War
            strikes against the sentient; Industry dismantles the non-sentient.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Key Expressions:</strong> Conjuration, Distillation, Mystic
            servitors, Nature- and Weather-work, Telekinesis, the Travel lattice
          </p>

          <p>
            Industry’s Approaches typically indicate a specialty in creating particular
            things, or describe the manner in which you create them. The typical
            tradeoff is quality versus speed.
          </p>

          <p>
            For those not deep in the Industry-nature, their Approach might be tied to
            artistic skill, or might even be disconnected from their own abilities
            entirely. Some people are mysteriously prone to stumbling across amazing
            feats of ancient sorcerous engineering, even if they could never create such
            things themselves.
          </p>

          <p>

          <p>
            The Mystery-Nature covers and uncovers. It moves the veil aside or draws it
            across the eyes of observers. Those well-versed in Mystery excel at
            extracting information from people and situations without revealing anything

          <p>
            When concealing, Mystery passively deflects the eye and the attention. To
            actively fool people, use Trickery. The two Natures have a fair amount of
            overlap when it comes to a quick wit and careful mind, but Trickery is more
            active and interactive. Those deep in the Mystery-nature are more likely to
            be quiet and unnoticed.

          <p>
            Mystery's more intellectual Approaches point out evidence or conclusions,
            but not both. You either get the answer or you get the reason for the
            answer. Someone with an instinctive nose for crime may spot a criminal, but
            will need investigative skills to prove wrongdoing. Meanwhile, a careful
            observer can pick up on clues during magical research, but will need
            scholarly talents to realize what they imply.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of Mystery's more secretive Approaches are unique magical talents for
            concealment, learned or bestowed via esoteric means. Invisibility,
            short-range teleportation through shadows, moving without a trace, leaving
            no magical signature, all of these ordinarily impossible tasks are potential
            Approach fodder.

          <p>
            The Self-Nature expresses itself in magic done for the sake of one's own
            being rather than for extrinsic purposes. Self magic is defensive and
            definitional. It proclaims who and what you are, and then safeguards that
            statement. Expressions of Self include shapeshifting, regeneration,
            immortality, adaptation, and protection from direct magical assaults like
            death spells and petrification. The mid-levels extend this to removing your
            base needs for food, water, and sleep. Soul-work such as binding and
            exorcism also fall under Self, though they might more properly be called
            “Other” than “Self”.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Key Expressions:</strong> Becoming, Shapeshifting, Soul-work,
            Warding
          </p>

          <p>
            The easiest things to change with Self are those things that you did not
            choose about yourself. The hardest things to change are those that you
            reinforced through a lifetime of tiny decisions. If you choose to get a
            tattoo, for instance, the regeneration granted by Self will not wipe it
            away, and even shapeshifting will retain it in some form. On the other hand,
            if someone else scarred you and you would prefer to be without that mark, it
            will soon disappear.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many players find it difficult to choose an Approach for their Self-nature.
            It may help to think of the Self-nature as a somewhat “meta” attribute when
            it comes to Approaches. Everything else about your character says who they
            are at this time. The Self-nature says how much they’ve invested into their
            present, or how quickly they’ll be capable of changing in the future.

          <div class="hangright">
            <img src="images/box-trap.svg" alt="" />
          </div>

          <p>Steal • Deceive • Escape</p>

          <p>
            The Trickery-nature longs to get away with things. It says, "Let me do what
            I want and I'll just be on my way." Unlike Mystery, Trickery is no two-sided
            coin – it exists solely to mislead and acquire. Whether it deals with
            emotion, physical objects, or even the flow itself, Trickery is happy to
            replace the expected with the unexpected, and even happier if someone else
            looks like a fool for it. Perhaps fortunately, Trickery does not help one
            avoid being fooled in return. Those deep in the Trickery-nature can
            substitute the unreal for the real, creating illusions, ruining flow
            supplies, stashing objects beyond the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trickery does not do well against magic that reads the soul, or that reads
            echoes left behind. In particular, psychometry cannot be fed false readings.
            You can disguise yourself when you act so that later psychometric readings
            may seem to show someone else, but you can't retroactively change what
            psychometry will show. Plan your heists in advance.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Key Expressions:</strong> Hallucination, Mental acuity, Personae,
            the Red Space, the Shell Game
          </p>

          <p>
            Trickery's approaches typically focus on your style. Each has its
            advantages; each has its blind spots. Are you flashy and distracting? Are
            you subtle enough that no one notices? Do people trust you against their
            better judgment? Whether you want to work with or against your existing
            Trickery skills is up to you. Some people are very good at weaving subtle
            plans... right up until everything explodes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember that Trickery is no good at countering itself. You can have "Can't
            connect" as a Communion Approach, and you can have "Talk them down" as a War
            Approach, but you can't have "No one can fool me" as a Trickery Approach.
            You're going to need a Mystery or Communion approach for that purpose
            instead.

          <p>
            The War-Nature encompasses all forms of violence, as well as many forms of
            physical or aggressive competition. Soldiers use War to gild their spears
            with lightning, move with unexpected speed, and defend their allies with
            wards. Generals use War to divine strategies for their armies and throw
            their enemies into disarray.
          </p>

          <p>
            The War-Nature is not good at true defense. It will hold territory for you,
            and keep a horde of warriors at bay with dread, but a parry made at War 3 is
            no equal for a War 3 assault. War’s best defense is a good offense.

            In many ways, War is the most straightforward of Natures. It’s going to ruin
            someone’s day. The only question is how. Could be subtle, could be

              Before the Gift, knowledgeable magi referred to a Nature they called

              term “Dominion” became inaccurate, and “War” became the common term. Only

          <p>
            In text form: Self is adjacent to Communion, which is next to Industry, then
            War, then Trickery, then Mystery, which wraps around to Self. If you’re

            <strong>higher</strong> Trickery-nature than your observer's Mystery or
            Communion (as appropriate). This is not a conflict, just a simple
            comparison.

          <h3 id="new_natures">New Natures?</h3>
          <p>
            Natures are meant to be a “complete set” to describe human abilities. Unlike
            with Paths, Founts, and Traditions, it will be very difficult to insert a
            new Nature into the game. However, see <a href="#supernatural_creatures">Supernatural Creatures</a>,
            which use custom Traditions and other methods to describe powerful non-human
            magical creatures.

          <h3>Supernatural Creatures</h3>
          <p>
            Inherently supernatural beings, such as dragons, ki‑rin, mokele-mbembe, or
            adamantine automata, are valid playable characters in this game just as
            ordinary humans are. In addition to setting an <a href="CharGen.xhtml#earthlyform">Earthly Form</a> for
            your character, you may also want to represent substantial, flexible magical
            power by creating a custom Tradition. This Tradition does not use the
            existing Paths and Founts (unless you find them particularly appropriate),
            but instead simply lists the type of being you are. You still select
            Expressions to act as the core of your supernatural might.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are capable of using Reserve to cast other spells, your Core
            Expressions still require flow and are impaired by Null Zones in the same
            way as spell-casting characters. If not, your Core Expressions can operate
            without external flow, but you cannot use Reserve to cast other spells.
            Regardless of which option you select, you can learn other Traditions
            normally.
          </p>

          <h4>Example: Phoenix</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Path:</strong> Phoenix <br />
            <strong>Fount:</strong> Elementalism <br />
            <strong>Core Expressions:</strong> Dream Travel, Energy waves, Healing,
            Nature-work, Uncountable Spinners, Warding
          </p>

          <h4>One-Trick Ponies</h4>
          <p>
            Some supernatural creatures aren’t imbued with a vast range of mystical
            powers. Instead, they have just one power, like turning people to stone, or
            being impossible to outrun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditions don’t model these sorts of abilities very well, but Approaches will
            handle them just fine. Consider taking Approaches like War (Turned to Stone)
            or Industry (Fastest Man Alive) to model these kinds of abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to give up something from the Universal Expressions list, you can
            do so, but you don’t get anything for it.

          <p>
            Twists are spent by <strong>players</strong> rather than by their characters.
            Characters do not realize that they have Approaches, nor that other characters
            have them. They don’t say things like “Well you failed with your magic, why
            not try spending Twists?” Twist-related events are often brushed off as luck,
            as coincidence, or as a natural part of who someone is (e.g. an army officer
            with War: Veteran).

        <section title="Disconnection">

          <h3 id="disconnection">Disconnection</h3>

          <p>
            Some people decide to "disconnect" from part of their Nature, abandoning
            that part of themselves. This drastic step is typically taken in
            reaction to trauma or fear. Disconnecting prevents people from harming
            you, but also severely limits the actions that you can take.
          </p>

          <p>
            The effects of disconnection require GM interpretation. Disconnection is
            not a purely mechanical action, it is also a curse, and attempts to
            weasel around its restrictions end in anguish and despair. Use the
            descriptions below as starting points and guidelines.
          </p>

          <h4>Communion</h4>

          <p>
            You cannot communicate with others in any way that allows you to get
            your point across. No one has any idea what you want, what you need, or
            what you're thinking – unless you attempt to mislead them, in which case
            they immediately see through your flimsy deceptions. You are incapable
            of art. In return, no one can change your mind in any way. Your emotions
            and intellect are barred to outside influence of any kind. So long as
            you do not try to lie, no one can determine what your motivations are.
          </p>

          <h4>Industry</h4>

          <p>
            You cannot create, build, craft, or design in any way. You can undertake
            artistic endeavors, but not practical ones, and your attempts to
            beautify the works of others introduce disastrous flaws. You lose things
            easily. In return, you need nothing from your surroundings. You always
            find shelter, food, and water. If you need to cross an ocean, you can
            walk across the waves. You cannot provide for others, but your own needs
            are always met. Aion is not generous when considering your needs.
          </p>

          <h4>Mystery</h4>

          <p>
            You cannot learn or remember coherent information. You eat when hungry,
            sleep when tired, and do not ask questions or exercise your will. You
            almost certainly become a hermit or a beggar. In return, no one can find
            you or learn about you. Your enemies will only find you if they
            literally stumble across you, and even then they may not realize who you
            are until you have already disappeared. You may even accidentally fall
            between worlds if someone devises a clever enough scheme to track you
            down.
          </p>

          <h4>Self</h4>

          <p>
            You feel that you are not real, and thus may have no true value or
            meaning. Your thoughts and feelings seem detached from you, and you find
            this very disturbing. In addition, these detached thought processes are
            often not aware of each other. For example, you might take actions based
            on one Core Value that you would normally avoid because it conflicts
            with another, and then simply ignore that you ever did so. When you are
            in this state all the pieces of your soul, no matter where they are,
            fold in on themselves and become inert. You can still use the Gift
            (except for expressions of Self), but others who have obtained pieces of
            your soul cannot use them in any way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Long-term changes to the Self, such as immortality, becoming, or
            shapeshifting, do not end when you are disconnected from it. One does
            not “snap back” to a previous state of being during disconnection.
          </p>

          <h4>Trickery</h4>

          <p>
            You cannot tell a lie. You become honest to a fault, but also tactless
            and crude, blurting out secrets that you would rather keep. You may even
            find yourself bringing up things you've done in the past – likely quite
            incriminating for a master of Trickery. When you are in this state, you
            see through illusions and dishonesty as if they were a child's
            scribbles. Any such expressions of the Trickery-Nature that would affect
            you are powerless against you – not that anyone will believe you when
            you tell them they’re being fooled.
          </p>

          <h4>War</h4>

          <p>
            You cannot intentionally harm others. You cannot cause violence,
            encourage people to violence, threaten and yell, or even make or
            interpret tactical plans. If you lift a heavy object, perhaps with
            Industry, you simply cannot drop it on someone. In return, no creature
            living or dead can harm you. Arrows turn before striking your body.
            Attempts to drain your power or set a curse on you abruptly fail. A net
            might catch you, but if it were weighted or painful, it might phase
            through you instead. Portals to the elemental plane of fire will refuse
            to admit you. War is probably the most common Nature from which people
            disconnect.
          </p>


          <h4>Game Effects</h4>

          <p>
            Being disconnected from one or more Natures does not impact your Power.
            Instead, reduce your Import by 2. You cannot do any magic related to
            your disconnected Nature, whether spellcasting or rituals. You cannot
            activate Approaches for disconnected Natures, though you can still store
            Twists in them.
          </p>

          <h4 id="reconnection">Reconnecting</h4>

          <p>To reconnect with your Nature, take the following steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Seek help. You must find someone you know to help you, or you must
              befriend someone new over the course of a month or more.
            </li>

            <li>Your helper must understand your state.</li>

            <li>
              Your helper must give you or lead you to a physical object or location
              that is a token of your Fount, which you must carry or protect for at
              least a week. Examples include an enchanted crystal for Elementalism, a
              statue of a saint for Glory, or a clock tower for Alchemy.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            At the end of the week, if you wish to return to yourself, you reconnect
            with all of your Natures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Someone can also restore you to wholeness by
            <a href="Magic.xhtml#giving_the_gift">Enchanting you as if you
              never received the Gift</a>, but that process is typically
            slower. Regardless of the method, you must still be willing to
            reconnect.

      <section class="subchapter" title="7. Expertise" epub:type="chapter">

        <h2 id="expertise">7. Expertise</h2>

        <p>
          Whereas Nature scores represent personal proclivities and mystical
          enhancement, Expertise represents your character’s training and
          experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          During character creation you will pick one or more types of Expertise,
          which will give you a certain number of Professions.
        </p>

        <p>
          All characters should have one and only one type of Mundane Expertise.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may also have selected the Expanded Expertise art as part of your
          Core Expressions, which will allow you to select one or more Mystical
          Expertise options. All of the Mystical options are compatible with each
          other, and the effects are cumulative. However, because they are granted
          by a particular magical art, these magically enhanced skills may change
          if you switch Traditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Professions are ranked 0-5, with higher rankings indicating greater
          skill and effectiveness. Some of the Expertise options will alter your
          <a href="#import">Import or Power score</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Baseline Expertise Options</h3>

        <p>
          Choose just one of these options. They are open to all characters
          regardless of enhancement.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Practitioner:</strong> You may choose three Professions and rate them 1, 2, and
          3. This is the default option.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Apprentice:</strong> Choose three Professions and rate them at 1, 1, and 2. This
          option is good for young characters who do not have a lot of experience
          under their belts. Apprentice-level Expertise gives you an additional
          point of Import, but does not change your Power score. Characters lose
          this benefit if they choose Polymath.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Sage:</strong> Choose four Professions and rate them at 2, 2, 3, and 3. This
          option is good for characters who are old and well-experienced but not
          reaping the benefits of immortality. Sage-level Expertise costs one
          point of Import, but does not change your Power score.
        </p>

        <h3>Mystical Expertise Options</h3>

        <p>
          Each of these options add one point to your character’s Power score,
          which will also reduce your Import.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Archetypal:</strong> You channel the experiences of a well-known folk hero or
          cultural stereotype. This might be literal (if you are a vessel for
          their possessing spirit), but more often you emulate that persona and
          take on their traits. Select five professions connected to this
          archetype and rank them all at level 3. When you use one of those
          professions, you take on a persona appropriate to the archetype. Treat
          that persona as a Core Value rated at the same rating as the Profession
          or higher. This persona does not go away quickly – you're stuck with it
          afterward for as long as you were using the Profession, minimum 1 hour.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Polymath:</strong> Your character is broadly competent in a vast array of fields.
          Perhaps they are a long-lived jack of all trades, or perhaps they have
          supernatural advisors. In any situation where Expertise is relevant,
          they have a rating of 2.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Prodigy:</strong> You have studied extensively in one particular area, or you
          have a natural knack in it. Pick one Fount and receive the Scholar and
          Theurge Professions, as well as one other related Profession, all at
          level 4.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Satori:</strong> You have a great depth of experience in a particular field, the
          kind only seen from a severely obsessed individual or an immortal who
          has dedicated a lifetime of effort to the topic. Choose a Profession and
          rank it at 5, and gain <a href="Rules.xhtml#comp_adv">Competitive Advantage</a> in that Profession.
          You must choose a Core Value that you consider linked to this
          Profession and rank it at level 5, optionally 4 if you are over 500
          years old.
        </p>

        <p>
          All characters are also assumed to be familiar with their home
          Civilization – its language, customs, values, history, geographical
          layout, and so forth. This is represented by the <strong>Local Profession</strong>, which
          all characters receive at level 2 for free.
        </p>

        <aside title="Choosing Natures and Expertise" id="choosing_natures_and_expertise">
          <h3>Choosing Natures and Expertise</h3>
          <p>
            If you’re unsure of where to set your Nature scores and what Expertise to
            choose, avoid the temptation to pad out a character with higher stats than
            you need for your concept. Because of the Power/Import balance, characters
            in Sorc are effective at all levels of Nature and Expertise. Don’t become a
            Polymath just because you think it would be useful. Having a lower Power
            score and getting an extra Twist from every Complication is awful useful
            too.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <aside title="Polymath Overlaps" id="polymath_overlaps">
          <h3>Polymath Overlaps</h3>
          <p>
            If your character is a Polymath, you may have a Society benefit that becomes
            worthless. For instance, you might have the Explorer profession rated at 2,
            and being a Polymath would normally give you that at 2 anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases, increase that bonus Profession to 3 instead. If the bonus
            profession is already 3 or higher, don’t change it.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <h3>Professions</h3>

        <p>
          All characters have one or more Professions. Each Profession allows your
          character to do a particular job, and indicates that you’ve been
          employed in this capacity in the past.
        </p>

        <p>Professions are ranked from 0-5.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A modicum of training – just a year or two. Many tasks are still likely
            to be beyond your reach.
          </li>

          <li>
            Professional level. Ten years of training. You can do almost all of the
            things that fall into your field, and can earn a living in this
            profession.
          </li>

          <li>
            A lifetime of experience. You are respected by others in this field and
            are capable of innovating within it.
          </li>

          <li>
            One of the best ever. Hundreds of years of experience, or complete
            obsession with the subject.
          </li>

          <li>Both centuries of experience and total obsession.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          A Profession represents a narrower focus than a Nature. Mystery, for
          example, covers nearly everything to do with discovery and concealment.
          Professions instead deal with a more specific area of human ability or
          knowledge. Professions like Magistrate, Criminal, and Spy all draw
          heavily on Mystery, but they put its raw power to use in very different
          ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite their narrowness, all the Professions include all of the skills
          necessary to do them well. For instance, the Samaritan profession
          includes firefighting, riot control, paramedic, and viral curse response
          training, as well as the ability to remain calm under fire and react
          quickly to danger. The Artist profession includes not only the ability
          to create art, but skill at incorporating memetic techniques in your
          work, presenting it for sale, publicizing your work, and handling your
          finances.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your character has only ever worked in a single industry or field,
          you probably only need one Profession. However, it’s not uncommon for
          characters to have half a dozen Professions. Many people work multiple
          jobs as they get older. Local, in particular, will be a very common
          Profession – everyone starts with it, and all those who’ve traveled and
          worked outside their home Civilization will have some degree of Local
          for their host Civilization.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <h3>Special Situations</h3>

          <h4>Concentrations</h4>

          <p>
            Some Professions require concentration in a specific area. Artist and
            Theurge are good examples. Sculptors can’t necessarily write poetry, nor
            can dream engineers build bridges. Treat these concentrations as
            completely different Professions.
          </p>

          <h4>Specialized Tasks</h4>

          <p>
            There are some things that untrained people just can’t do. Anyone can
            plant a backyard garden; only someone with the Farmer profession can
            manage a full-sized farm. Anyone can throw a spear; only someone trained
            in the Soldier profession can expect to do it accurately under pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each Profession gives some examples of specialized tasks. You can’t even
            attempt a specialized task unless you have the right Profession.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clearly this requires a certain amount of adjudication, and not all
            groups will contain an expert politician player to answer questions
            about Politics, or a policeman with forty years of experience to speak
            authoritatively about what the Magistrate profession should include.
            Because Professions are intended to be restrictive, if the answer is
            uncertain, treat it as a “no.”
          </p>

          <h4>Relevant Experience</h4>

          <p>
            If you have a Profession that’s closely related to another one you want
            to use, you can substitute your Profession by spending a point of
            Reserve. An example would be holding a press conference using Politician
            instead of Prolocutor, or using Magistrate instead of Lawyer to
            understand the implications of a new law. You still can’t do specialized
            tasks.
          </p>

          <h4>Low-Flow Environments</h4>

          <p>
            All Professions are dependent on the magical arts, even apparently
            simple ones like Farmer. This results in a penalty to Professions in
            Null Zones and areas with otherwise restricted flow: -1 in a -1 Null
            Zone, and -2 in any higher level. This can change the answer to the
            <a href="Rules.xhtml#basic">Four
              Questions</a> if a character’s Profession drops low enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            This penalty affects all areas of skill within a profession. Diplomats
            are used to taking certain mindsets that generate and react to
            particular types of flow. When that flow isn’t present, their
            conversations are less sparkling, their political interactions are less
            certain. Soldiers who instinctually expect to be able to take a sword
            strike on their arm because their mind has made their body like iron
            will almost certainly lose the arm. Explorers need tents they can
            understand, theurges need advisory spirits, and magistrates cannot
            afford to be baffled by a lack of equipment. Being dropped in the past
            (figuratively speaking) can turn any expert into a novice again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certain characters are exempt from this penalty — specifically, those in
            a <a href="Cultures.xhtml#returner_cults">Returner cult</a>. Characters who leave their cult and learn
            the ways of another civilization become used to the ways of magic and
            begin taking the penalty. Characters with
            <a href="Magic.xhtml#Null_Tolerance">Null Tolerance</a> are
            not exempt, but do reduce the penalty by one point.
          </p>

        <section title="Profession List" class="profession_list">
        <h3>Profession List</h3>

        <p>
          The professions below each list the Nature most commonly associated with
          them. The GM may agree that a different Nature is more important under
          certain circumstances. For instance, Athletes typically access Self to
          play their sport, but might use Trickery during contract negotiations.
          Magistrates would use War rather than Mystery when chasing down a
          criminal. Professions are intended to be fairly broad, and there are
          often many different ways to employ them.
        </p>

        <h4>Artist (Two Specific Arts) {Communion}</h4>

        <p>
          Artist concentrations include playing an instrument, novel writing,
          sculpture, singing, dancing, painting, dream design, and any other sort
          of aesthetic endeavor. Since most artists have more than a single
          talent, those who pick the Artist Profession can choose two specialties,
          such as singing and playing the guitar.
        </p>

        <p>
          Good artists will also know how best to arrange and sell their wares,
          incorporate memetic techniques, critique the works of others, and have
          good networking skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          All tasks for this Profession are considered highly specialized. Someone
          without any levels in this Profession is stuck drawing stick figures.
        </p>

        <h4>Athlete (Specific Sport) {Self}</h4>

        <p>
          Good athletes can not only play their sport of choice, they can promote
          themselves, work up crowds, and analyze other teams’ strategies. There
          are two specialized tasks for Athletes: coaching, and recalling obscure
          or rarely-used rules such as baseball’s infield fly rule.
        </p>

        <h4>Clergy {Communion}</h4>

        <p>
          Religious figures know their doctrine, and often the doctrine of other
          religions as well. They can communicate effectively to large groups, and
          know how to recruit new members. They are familiar with emotional
          magics, and know how to recognize them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deeper aspects of the religious doctrine are considered specialized
          tasks.
        </p>

        <h4>Courtesan (Specific Civilization) {Communion}</h4>

        <p>
          Courtesan is the art of attracting people for a short-term or long-term
          emotional or sexual relationship. Many people pick up a point or two of
          Courtesan in their lives. Professionals may be escorts or sex workers,
          but may also be courtiers in certain cultures.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working successfully in a region that denounces this profession is a
          specialized task.
        </p>

        <h4>Criminal {Trickery}</h4>

        <p>
          Criminals know how to identify and bypass wards, pick locks, disarm
          magical traps, and run numbers or confidence scams. They know other
          criminals, can critique law-enforcement and security methods, and can
          sneak around to evade capture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Almost all Criminal tasks are specialized. Running a simple scam like
          three-card monte is not, but such things are unlikely to fool anyone in
          this age.
        </p>

        <h4>Explorer {Mystery}</h4>

        <p>
          Exploring the Great Basin is not as dangerous as it once was, but the
          land is still far from tame. Explorers can hike, swim, scale cliffs,
          spelunk, kayak, identify monster spoor, hunt their own food, and
          generally make their way across the wilderness. When traveling to a new
          world, they can determine whether the world’s conditions, flora, and
          fauna are dangerous to human life. Trained explorers often have a good
          eye for placing settlements, and know basic surveying and orienteering
          techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
          With access to magic, there are few tasks in this Profession that would
          be considered specialized – perhaps scouting and spelunking. Without
          magic, however, consider any task more complex than hiking to be
          specialized.
        </p>

        <h4>Farmer {Industry}</h4>

        <p>
          This Profession covers everything you need to live off the land: when to
          plant and harvest, how to predict the weather, how to sell your crops to
          the public or a distributor, how to handle livestock, irrigation and
          hydroponics techniques, and a basic understanding of livestock breeding.
        </p>

        <p>
          All Farmer tasks are considered specialized, except for basic planting
          and harvesting.
        </p>

        <h4>Healer {Communion}</h4>

        <p>
          <a href="Magic.xhtml#Healing">Magical healing</a> can cure most natural wounds and
          illnesses with only a cursory knowledge of this profession. Healers know
          how to handle matters without magic, but also how to mend sorcerous
          ailments that resist treatment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dealing with a curse or magically aggravated wound is considered a
          specialized task.
        </p>

        <h4>Historian {Mystery}</h4>

        <p>
          Historians study past events and cultures to better understand them.
          Many are good at solving puzzles and riddles. Anthropologists studying
          modern cultures would also use this profession in this game.
        </p>

        <p>All Historian tasks are specialized.</p>

        <h4>Lawyer (Specific Civilization) {Trickery}</h4>

        <p>
          The legal systems of many civilizations are in a precarious state – both
          complicated and unsuited to a magical world. You know the law for your
          chosen civilization in depth, and can accurately guess whether new
          actions would be considered legal. You can also argue your case in
          court, or draft new laws for a specific effect. The
          <a href="Cultures.xhtml#brightgarden">Brightgarden Schema</a>
          is a good choice for specialization, as several
          civilizations have accepted it at least in part.
        </p>

        <p>
          Courtroom argumentation and the interpretation of laws are specialized
          tasks. In locales where the laws are not available via Universal
          Repository (e.g most Unruly Lands), nearly the entire profession is
          considered specialized.
        </p>

        <h4>Linguist {Mystery}</h4>

        <p>
          Linguists study the principles of language and communication. Actual
          skill in communication falls under Communion-based professions –
          Linguistics is more about decoding ancient languages. Because spells
          inscribed in stone or clay are most likely to survive through the ages,
          linguists are often called upon to translate ancient spells into a
          modern paradigm.
        </p>

        <p>All Linguist tasks are specialized.</p>

        <h4>Local (Specific Civilization) {Communion}</h4>

        <p>
          You must concentrate in a particular Civilization when choosing this
          Profession.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Profession represents familiarity with a Civilization, its
          subcultures, languages, beliefs, geography, politics, well-known laws,
          and more. You can understand natives of your chosen civilization without
          the True Speech.
        </p>

        <p>
          All tasks for this Profession are considered specialized. All characters
          receive this Profession for their home civilization at level 2. Some
          characters will increase it as they grow older; others will be content
          with the areas and people they know.
        </p>

        <h4>Magistrate {Mystery}</h4>

        <p>
          Magistrates are equal parts judge, detective, and sergeant. They
          investigate breaches of the law and marshal soldiers to respond to
          dangerous events or individuals. A good magistrate can also interrogate
          informants, keep an angry crowd from rioting, subdue a dangerous
          criminal, and more.
        </p>

        <p>All Magistrate tasks are specialized.</p>

        <h4>Medium {Communion}</h4>

        <p>
          The Great Basin has many <a href="Cultures.xhtml#spirits">spirits</a>. Mediums are
          those who know their society and their habits, can speak with them on
          their own terms, and can act as a conduit for their power.
        </p>

        <p>
          Specialized tasks for Mediums include calling to and speaking with
          nearby spirits, and opening oneself to possession without suffering
          emotional influence from the possessing spirit.
        </p>

        <h4>Merchant {Industry}</h4>

        <p>
          You can buy and sell goods, to the public or to distributors. You can
          make reliable predictions of markets, use and resist sales techniques,
          create complex business plans, and ensure that your own company is
          properly run. You have a good head for administration.
        </p>

        <p>Only market prediction and business planning are specialized tasks.</p>

        <h4>Prolocutor {Trickery}</h4>

        <p>
          Prolocutors are agents, advertisers, and paid representatives. They can
          organize campaigns, do some minor writing and editing work, spread or
          squash rumors, hold press conferences, and know how to release materials
          into the Universal Repositories so they gain notice. This Profession
          also covers investigative reporting and some general information
          gathering.
        </p>

        <p>
          Spreading credible rumors and creating memetic devices are specialized
          tasks.
        </p>

        <h4>Politician {Trickery}</h4>

        <p>
          Politicians know how to work a crowd, get legislation passed, lobby for
          changes in laws, cut through red tape (or snare others in it), recognize
          sorcerous manipulation, and perhaps engage in some themselves. They can
          behave properly in high society, negotiate treaties, and write
          legislation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most political tasks are considered specialized, not necessarily because
          of a need for specific information or training, but because the insiders
          who hold power resent intruders.
        </p>

        <h4>Samaritan {Industry}</h4>

        <p>
          Samaritans are those who look out for others, helping them stay safe and
          healthy in a dangerous world. Samaritans are firefighters, riot-calmers,
          paramedics, and curse-lifters. Their training includes the ability to
          remain calm under fire and react quickly to danger.
        </p>

        <p>
          Responding competently to any sort of life-threatening event is a
          specialized task.
        </p>

        <h4>Scholar (Specific Fount) {Mystery}</h4>

        <p>Any Fount of magic is a suitable concentration for this Profession.</p>

        <p>
          Scholars not only study existing information, they can create reasonable
          hypotheses and the experiments needed to test them. The analysis of flow
          and its aspects is done through this Profession. They can also contact
          other researchers in their field and they can inspect others’ theories
          for flaws.
        </p>

        <p>
          All tasks are specialized, including looking up existing information
          without access to a Universal Repository.
        </p>

        <h4>Soldier {War}</h4>

        <p>
          Soldiers can not only strike accurately and keep their head in battle,
          they have a working knowledge of tactics and strategy, can deploy
          countermeasures for the best effect, can recognize existing strategies
          and the flaws inherent in them, and can endure significant physical
          trauma.
        </p>

        <p>
          Merely shooting a bow or being in a fight is not a specialized task.
          Keeping one’s cool or organizing a strategy are.
        </p>

        <h4>Spy {Trickery}</h4>

        <p>
          Spies can analyze and prepare reports, sneak around unnoticed, disguise
          themselves, conduct surveillance, and infiltrate closed organizations.
        </p>

        <p>All elements of this Profession are considered specialized.</p>

        <h4>Teacher (Specific Nature) {Communion}</h4>

        <p>
          Teachers instruct others in the use of a particular Profession,
          Tradition, or Nature. Each teacher must specialize in a particular
          Nature, and may teach topics that they understand within that field.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are no specialized tasks for this Profession, though one should
          remember that teaching without this Profession costs a point of Reserve
          each time and can be very draining.
        </p>

        <h4>Theurge (Specific Fount) {Industry}</h4>

        <p>Any Fount of magic is a suitable concentration for this Profession.</p>

        <p>
          Theurges do practical things with their magic of choice. All of them can
          create and critique the designs for devices or expressions that fall
          under their concentration. Theurges of Earthpower make living organisms
          or apply them to a given problem. Theurges of Oneirmancy make
          dream-worlds and custom Rapport connections. Theurges of Glory build
          cathedrals or auras of beauty and radiance. Each Fount covers a wide
          range of practical end products, but with a narrow range of styles and
          expressions that fit that Fount.

          <p>
            The list of Professions is intended to be a fairly extensive set, but not
            necessarily a complete one. If you can’t exactly find what you’re looking
            for, feel free to invent a Profession with your GM’s approval. For instance,
            you might create an assassin character by taking Spy, Soldier, and
            Criminal... or you could create an Assassin Profession that provides only a
            few pieces from all three.

            <li>Synthesist becomes Oracle.</li>

              Analyst becomes Augur. Augurs predict the future though they don't always
              know how it's going to happen. Oracles say what's going to be important
              though they don't necessarily know how.

      <section class="subchapter" title="8. Power, Import,  Reserve, and Twists" epub:type="chapter">

        <h2 id="import">8. Power, Import, Reserve, and Twists</h2>

        <p>
          Now that you have the rest of your character complete, you can find your
          Import and Power scores, and the Twists and Reserve points that are
          based on them.
        </p>

        <h3>Power</h3>

        <p>
          Your Power score represents the strength of the mystical arts at your
          character’s disposal, including any enhanced levels of skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each of your character’s Traditions has its own separate Power score.
          You calculate that as follows:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Average your top two Nature scores (round up). This is your base Power
            for that Tradition.
          </li>

          <li>If your other four Nature scores are all 1, subtract 1.</li>

          <li>
            If you have <a href="Rules.xhtml#infra">Infrastructure</a>, add one to Power. You can only
            have one level of Infrastructure.
          </li>

          <li>
            Add one to Power for each type of
            <a href="#expertise">Mystical Expertise</a> you have.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          You should end up with a number between 0 and 10 for each Tradition.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your Power score is subtracted from the number of Twists you get from
          any Complication gained through the <a href="Rules.xhtml#bad_luck">Bad Luck Rule</a>. They do not
          affect twists gained through the <a href="Rules.xhtml#worst_enemy">Worst Enemy Rule</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the primary balance of Sorcerously Advanced: if you want to use
          a lot of Twists, you will need to choose low Nature scores or be ok with
          them backfiring on you. If you want powerful reliable magic, you will
          have to be ok with spending Twists less often.
        </p>

        <p>
          Power score measures physical and mental capabilities – capabilities
          that can be stretched in times of need. Your Power score is also your
          maximum number of Reserve points, used to push your character’s innate
          abilities. The Game Play chapter has a summary of what
          <a href="Rules.xhtml#reserve_reference">Reserve</a> can be used for.
        </p>

        <p>If your Power score is 0, you still get 1 point of Reserve.</p>

        <h3>Import</h3>

        <p>
          On the other side of things, your Import score represents your
          character’s importance to the plot, irrespective of any other
          attributes. The higher your Power score is, the lower your total Import
          will be.
        </p>

        <p>As with Power, each Tradition has its own separate Import score.</p>

        <p>First, subtract your Power score from 12.</p>

        <p>
          If your Mundane Expertise is Sage, subtract a point of Import. If it’s
          Apprentice, add a point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your Import score indicates how often you can use your Approaches. You
          start each session with a number of Twists equal to your Import, spread
          out however you like amongst your Natures (max of 6 in each). You will
          spend these to create problems for others and opportunities for your own
          character.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some changes to your character raise Power; others lower Import. Raising
          Power is the bigger deal – your Power score sets your Import, so when
          you raise Power you automatically lower Import every time. The reverse
          is not true: when you alter your Import, it doesn’t change your Power
          score.
        </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>

        <p>
          A character with a single Tradition where every attribute is at 3 has a
          Power of 3 and Import 9.
        </p>

        <p>A character with two different traditions might look as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            They learned one Tradition for day-to-day use. It has Comm 3, Ind 3,
            Myst 5, Self 3, Trick 1, and War 1. This gives them Power 4 / Import 8.
          </li>

          <li>
            Their other Tradition is for dangerous situations. It has Comm 3, Ind 5,
            Myst 3, Self 5, Trick 5, and War 5, and the Archetypal Expertise to pick
            up some war-related professions. This is Power 5 / Import 7.
          </li>

          <li>
            It costs them 1 Reserve to
            <a href="CharGen#switch_trad">switch between Traditions</a>. When they go from
            the first to the second one, their Reserve increases by 1 and they lose
            a Twist. Assuming they have different Paths and Founts, they’ll spend
            another 2 Twists the first time they use magic in the new Traditions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <aside title="Import, Power, and  Switching Traditions">
          <h3 id="switch_trad">Import, Power, and Switching Traditions</h3>
          <p>
            When you change Traditions, your Power changes, so your Import also changes.
            You should adjust your current number of Reserve and Twists appropriately.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, if you go from Import 6 to Import 4, you should lose 2 Twists.
            If you go from Power 4 to Power 1, you should lose 3 Reserve. If you switch
            to a higher Import or Power, you gain Twists or Reserve instead. Generally
            you’ll be gaining one and losing the other.
          </p>
          <p>You can take the lost Twists out of whatever Natures you want.</p>
          <p>
            If this change would give you a negative number of Twists or Reserve, you
            can’t change Traditions right now. This rule is here to keep someone from
            blowing all their Reserve with a high-Power character, then switching to a
            Tradition where they’re low-Power / high-Import and taking advantage of all
            their newfound Twists. No double-dipping.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don’t forget that you need to spend a point of Reserve to change Traditions
            in the first place, and there’s a 1-Twist surcharge when you use a new Path
            or Fount (maximum 2 per game).

          Marker is a fire elemental that can take on a variety of forms,
          sometimes several at once. She is originally from one of the Worlds
          Beyond, an elemental plane, and joined Nova after she found their
          intrepid explorers near her home.
