        Aion took its eye and made the sun.<br />
        Aion took its hearts and made the moons. <br />
        Aion's every wish becomes a star.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aion gave life to its thoughts, and these are the Worlds Beyond and the
        gods who dwell there.Aionve life to its hopes and fears, and these are
        the people of the world.
