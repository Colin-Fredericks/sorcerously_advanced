      Magic is the lifeblood of the Great Basin. Raw magical power rains down (some
      would say “wells up”) invisibly into the Basin at all times from eternal and
      untouchable fountains that exist beyond all worlds. It flows into the world
      through all people, all things, and all thoughts. To understand the Basin and
      its civilizations, you must understand magic.

    <p>
      There’s a lot of detail in this chapter for those who enjoy metaphysics or
      want to play a theoretician. First, though, we’ll cover the basics of what you
      need to know if you just want to throw spells around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using an Expression, casting a spell, and employing a magical Art are all the
      same thing. The terms are used interchangeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the <a href="Magic.xhtml#universal_arts">Universal Expressions</a> and the spells you
      selected as Core Expressions as much as you want. If you want to cast other
      spells, you need to spend a point of Reserve each time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spells are fueled by tapping the flow of magical power. Typically you will
      find as much power available as you need, as long as your spell doesn’t
      require a “large” or “tremendous” amount of flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you’re in a Null Zone (a region of weak flow where magic is difficult),
      certain spells may become unavailable due to reduced flow Nature reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spells can have <a href="#side_effects">side effects</a>.
      Chakra Occlusion has defined game
      effects, but you or the GM will decide when to trigger other side effects
      through the <a href="Rules.xhtml#bad_luck">Bad Luck Rule</a> or the <a href="Rules.xhtml#worst_enemy">Worst Enemy Rule</a>. If no one
      triggers a side effect, they might still happen but their effects are minimal.
      Similarly, many spells require that the flow have certain qualities, called
      aspects, but you only need to worry about that when the GM decides that it’s
      relevant. You can usually assume you have what you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game effect for most of your spells is to change what kinds of things you
      can do, either in free play or during a conflict. Shapeshifting, for example,
      doesn’t change your Self-Nature score, it just allows you to apply it in
      situations where it might not have previously applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those are the basics. You can keep reading for more detail, or skip to
      <a href="#spell_list">the spell list</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="magic_terminology">Terminology</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flow is the power you tap into to create mystical effects – part intangible
        fluid and part energy carrier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mystical is a generalized adjective for things that have to do with magic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Magic is the act of accomplishing things using intent and flow. When you use
        magic, you might take the form of a hawk, throw a lightning bolt, or enter
        Rapport with your allies. You take actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Paths are how you make magic happen, Founts are the kind of magic you do,
        and your Nature determines what you can accomplish with that magic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each act of magic is an Expression of a Nature, also called a Spell or an
        Art.
      </li>
      <li>
        Metaphysics is the set of principles on which the flow operates. When you
        use metaphysics, you might observe the Founts, learn how the flow moves and
        reacts, or experiment with strongly aspected flow and various complex
        intents. You study.
      </li>
      <li>
        Theurgy is the art of constructing sophisticated, reliable generators of
        Expressions from metaphysical principles. Think of it as mystical
        engineering.
      </li>
      <li>
        Technology is the tangible, sustained result of theurgy – the devices or
        procedures that create magical Expressions
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section class="subchapter" title="Flow" epub:type="chapter">
    <h2 id="flow">Flow</h2>

    <p>
      The world is saturated with flow, a self-renewing expression of the raw,
      unshaped potential to act. It is the basis of all existence, both natural and
      supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is much like the movement of water: there are streams through which the
      flow moves, places where it swirls in vortices, and places that are nearly
      devoid of it (Null Zones) as a desert is devoid of water. Flows join to become
      rivers (ley lines), which move toward the edge of the Basin and spill into the
      endless void.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flow goes by different names in different parts of the world. The citizens and
      researchers of Nova Commonwealth refer to “flux”, which they measure in thaums
      per second. Diadem's people, with their island cities, speak of “the current”.
      Sorcerers among the Black Sand Architects called it “silt”, “tremor”, and
      “wind”, and the Fellowship of Truth call it “The Breath of Aion”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flow is given character and aspect by the ways in which it enters the
      world. Flow that enters through a bonfire becomes fire-aspected. The outflow
      from a cemetery obtains aspects of death and veneration. There are as many
      aspects as there are adjectives in all the languages of the Basin. For weak
      magic, as in a sloppy sentence, a “close enough” aspect is good enough. To
      construct powerful Expressions, the flow's aspects must be just right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects and people have aspects as well, which suffuse the flow that wells up
      through them. Some of these aspects are inherent, based on their composition,
      like a stone's elemental aspect or a feather's lightness. Other aspects are
      imbued, attached by use. A staff used for walking will have the aspect of
      travel; one used for fighting will have aspects suitable for war. Imbued
      aspects are generally more valuable in spellcasting than inherent aspects,
      though there are exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that flow aspects do not oppose one another. The mere presence of
      honor-flow does not make Trickery harder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flow is often aspected in
      multiple different ways. When magi use it they choose a particular
      aspect to use. However, two magi pulling from the same source might
      both be able to use the entirety of the flow, but in completely
      different manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imbalance is dangerous. Too much of one aspect flowing through a part of the
      Basin will change the world to fit, and that part will generate more and more
      heavily aspected flow. It is because of this that the Great Basin’s volcanos
      are more active, its jungles deeper, its seas more glittering and deep.
      Individuals who tap into too much of one kind of flow may become aspected
      themselves, and find their personalities or their bodies drifting in that
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flow is sometimes <a href="Worlds.xhtml#kaleidoflow">different in other worlds</a>.
    </p>

    <aside title="Foraging for Aspect">
      <h3 id="forage_aspect">Foraging for Aspect</h3>
      <p>
        Aspected flow is required for a great many magical purposes. Sometimes it’s
        easy to find; sometimes it’s not. If you’re in a modern environment (like
        most city-states), the local ley lines probably distribute many different
        aspects throughout the area, but what if you’re in the wilderness?
      </p>
      <p>
        GMs should be fairly generous in allowing characters to “forage” for
        specific aspects. If you’re in the desert and need to conjure water, a
        cactus probably has a little water-aspect flowing through it. If you’re
        underwater and need solidly-aspected flow to repair something, look for
        shellfish. Need a distraction to escape a party? Surely you can pull some of
        the aspect of foolishness from the spiked punch. You might not get a lot of
        what you want quickly, but you can often find enough to get by in a pinch.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <aside title="Aspects of Flow">
      <h3 id="aspect_examples">Aspects of Flow</h3>
      <p>A non-exhaustive list of examples:</p>
      <p>
        Air, Anger, Arrogance, Benevolence, Blood, Calm, Caution, Chaos, Clarity,
        Cold, Comfort, Confusion, Connection, Death, Decay, Disease, Division,
        Earth, Falsehood, Fertility, Fire, Force, Growth, Honor, Ice, Impermanence,
        Impulsivity, Law, Life, Might, Mud, Noise, Oblivion, Pain, Permanence,
        Poison, Quiet, Rage, Revenge, Sass, Solidity, Stench, Stone, Treasure,
        Truth, Unctuousness, Vigor, Water, Weight, Wonder, Wood, Void, Yearning,
        Youth, Zen
      </p>
    </aside>

    <aside title="Who Decides Which Aspect?">
      <h3 id="who_decides_aspect">Who Decides Which Aspect?</h3>
      <p>
        Different magical institutions view the world differently. Even
        elementalists from different Traditions might disagree – does water have the
        aspect of impermanence because it is ever-changing, or does it have the
        aspect of permanence because through those changes it yet remains water?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because magic is a culturally and individually interpreted phenomenon, the
        person gathering the flow makes that decision. They pick a single aspect –
        one specific adjective – to obtain and/or store. If an elementalist comes
        across a knot with water-flow within, they can use it for whatever purpose
        they might use water-flow. If they instead come across a knot with the
        aspect of permanence, one magus might be able to substitute that for
        water-flow in a pinch, but another might only be able to use it as
        earth-flow. There’s no “history” to flow, no indication of where it
        originally came from.
      </p>
    </aside>


    <h3 id="measuring_flow">Measuring and Storing Flow</h3>

    <p>
      This game uses a narrative scale to roughly describe the amount of flow a
      particular act requires. The scale is:
    </p>
    <ul class="compact_list no_bullets">
      <li>Tremendous</li>
      <li>Large</li>
      <li>Moderate</li>
      <li>Small</li>
      <li>Minimal</li>
      <li>None</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Typical areas have a large flow. Tapping the flow stalls it, but it begins
      moving again very quickly – even if someone constantly focuses moderate
      amounts there's enough to go around. Tremendous (or larger) amounts of flow
      can typically only be found at ley lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human bodies generate a small amount of flow. With a bit of focus, one can
      build to a moderate amount and release it through a spell. Higher levels of
      Industry develop methods to store flow within the body without the need for
      concentration, or even in <a href="#Knotwork">knots</a>
      outside the body. Rapport can be
      a conduit for flow, allowing magi to transfer it across long distances, but
      for larger amounts one must use projects of the Industry-nature to construct
      ley lines.
    </p>


    <aside title="Null Zones">
      <h3 id="null_zones">Null Zones</h3>

      <p>
        When characters enter Null Zones, reduce their effective Nature and
        Profession scores as follows, to a minimum score of Nature&#160;1 and
        Profession&#160;0.
      </p>

      <ol start="1">
        <li>
          <strong>Shallow:</strong> An area with notably less flow than usual.
          Spells requiring large amounts of flow are impossible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Typical:</strong> A typical Null Zone with very little flow.
          Spells requiring moderate flow are impossible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deep:</strong> A region almost devoid of flow, like the depths
          of space. Spells requiring outside flow are impossible. Only one's
          personal flow is available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Devoid:</strong> That's not a Null Zone, it's a sentient land
          that has awoken as a Flow Parasite.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Null Zones do not kill, but characters with exotic Earthly Forms should
        prepare carefully before entering a deep Null Zone.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <aside title="Ley Lines">
      <h3 id="ley_lines">Ley Lines</h3>
      <p>
        The flow moves somewhat like water. There are Null Zones: places that stay
        high and dry; and there are ley lines: places where it rages in torrents
        through well-worn pathways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flow is normally invisible, but in the concentrations one finds in a ley
        line it becomes a bright current of light, or even crashing lightning. Most
        hover a few stories above the ground. Nearly all of them flow rimward. There
        are also places where flow “pools” and large amounts are stored naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        A standard application of Infrastructure-level Industry is shifting ley
        lines from place to place. This is not unlike moving a riverbed, both in
        that it requires substantial earth-moving efforts, and in that it is not
        always successful. Some ley lines simply want to return to their course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ley lines can also be “fractured”, breaking them in to a number of smaller
        lines. The fracturing process is often dangerous, pouring aspected flow into
        the local area and potentially polluting the flow of an entire city. The
        reverse process is simpler and easier, but only when the aspects of the two
        flows match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone with Industry 3 or higher can tap into ley lines for tremendous
        amounts of flow. Mystery 4+ can be used to read the aspects on a ley line
        and determine what events affected it upstream. Tracking the influence to
        its source requires Mystery 5.
      </p>
    </aside>

  </section>
  <section class="subchapter" title="Intent, Meaning, and Symbols" epub:type="chapter">
    <h2 id="intent_meaning">Intent, Meaning, and Symbols</h2>
    <p>
      Intents and meanings shape the flow to generate magical effects. Intent is the
      only thing that can perform magic. Intent is, in fact, the only thing strictly
      needed to perform magic. However, with intent alone, one can only summon forth
      the crudest expressions of one's Nature. All the trappings of magical
      traditions serve to focus intent, to make it more reliable, to help it endure,
      or to clothe it so that one's true intent is not so easily discerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symbols convey intents and meanings. Therefore, symbols also shape the flow.
      They can focus it, redirect it, or change its character. The more one's intent
      matches the character of the available flow, the faster and easier it is to
      shape an effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because meaning, passion, and nuance shape mystical Expressions, spells cannot
      easily be translated from one intent to another. Swords cannot easily be beat
      into plowshares. The major exception is magic based on the Trickery-Nature. It
      is in the very nature of Trickery to subvert all things to other purposes,
      even itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also difficult to use spells that were created by someone from a
      different civilization. Symbolism is highly variable from one culture to
      another, and the caster’s interpretation changes their mental state, warping
      the spell. Therefore, a large part of mystic scholarship is the study of
      history and cultural anthropology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symbols need not be written – a rose can be a symbol, as can a gesture.
      Archetypes, too, are a kind of symbol.
      <a href="#canon_form">Canonical Forms</a> are symbols
      that are an inherent part of a person or a culture.
    </p>

    <h3 id="magical_signatures">Magical Signatures</h3>

    <p>
      Because magic works through intent, it can reveal intent as well. Because it
      flows through all things, it connects people with one another and with the
      world. This manifests in individuals and their surroundings, creating a
      personal “signature” unique to each person each time they use magic. This
      signature can be detected using Expressions of Mystery and concealed with
      Trickery.
    </p>

    <h3 id="mystic_connections">Mystic Connections</h3>

    <p>
      Some arts, like healing, soul-work, or long-distance Rapport, require a mystic
      connection in order to operate. This can be achieved via any of the following
      methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are currently touching the subject</li>
      <li>
        You share a Core Value with the subject (only works to a distance of about
        10 koss)
      </li>
      <li>The subject has a positive Core Value that involves you personally</li>
      <li>
        The subject has a positive Core Value involving someone near you who is
        willing to help
      </li>
      <li>
        The subject has a positive Core Value involving an object or location that
        you touch
      </li>
      <li>
        You touch an object or location that the subject built themselves with care
      </li>
      <li>You own a piece of the subject's soul</li>
      <li>
        The subject inflicted you with a curse or enchantment that is still active
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Core Values used for this purpose must be rated at 2+.
      Those derived from one’s civilization are too
      broad to be used for this purpose – you need something more personal. Society
      CVs do work. CVs with a negative emotional weight also don't count. If someone
      hates you, that doesn't make it easier for you to curse them at a distance or
      harass them with unwanted dreams.
    </p>

    <h3 id="flow_and_thought">Flow and Human Thought</h3>

    <p>
      Aspected flow both comes from and influences the world. That includes human
      beings. When you are angry, the flow you generate is tinged with anger. Those
      around you may become more agitated. When you are surrounded by calm people,
      you tend to be more calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a continental scale, this influences the development of civilizations and
      their infrastructure. The Hearth-kin promote joy and exuberance, and so the
      world around them grows to be so. The Ægis value honor and diligence, and so
      magic that enforces such things is easier, which makes them more prevalent,
      which generates more of that sort of flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one might imagine, this can sometimes be problematic, especially with more
      destructive aspects.
    </p>

  </section>
  <section class="subchapter" title="Casting Magic" epub:type="chapter">
    <h2 id="casting_magic">Casting Magic</h2>
    <p>
      To create a particular mystical effect (an “Expression” or “spell”), one uses
      a particular Path to shape the flow following the symbols and archetypes of a
      Fount. Unless one's Path states otherwise, this requires a set of tools
      appropriate to the Path, and the ability to reach those tools. Most people
      carry a kit of these with them at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spellcasting does not necessarily require speech or wide gestures. It may even
      be a purely mental exercise in some cases. Regardless, it can
      <a href="#detect_magic">often be detected</a> by those who are wary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Tradition has a varied set of approaches to magic, honed over decades or
      centuries. They acknowledge that a dangerous life in the Basin may require
      flexibility in spellcasting. Someone following the path of Language might
      write their spells, speak them aloud, or burn a scroll. An Artisan might
      prefer to work in pastels, but can spout poetry in a pinch. Taking away a
      single tool is rarely enough to stop someone from using magic, and for those
      who can operate without tools, binding or gagging alone is rarely sufficient.
    </p>

    <aside>
      <h3 id="detect_magic">Detecting Magic</h3>
      <p>
        This game often involves investigative questions like “Is she using X?”,
        “Does his magical signature include Y?”, “Is that made of Z?” or “Are there
        any Q nearby?” If you want to check for the presence of a particular Art,
        the Nature score cutoff is Mystery 3+, or Mystery 4+ for Uncast arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone is using arts with the Loud descriptor and you’re above the
        cutoff: Yes, you can tell, and the GM should be telling you without you even
        asking. For many Loud Expressions you will be able to tell even if you’re
        below the cutoff. The GM should be fairly generous.
      </p>
      <p>
        For arts that are neither Loud nor Silent: You can tell, but you’ll have to
        check, or perhaps be around the person for a while. People can notice you
        checking them for auras if they are above the cutoff. It’s possible for
        someone with a higher Trickery than your Mystery to hide their use of these
        arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        For arts that are Silent: You must be above the cutoff. You’ll need time to
        examine the person carefully, and you will need to specify what you are
        looking for. You can also, if you have someone for a long time, examine them
        for a wide range of Silent enhancements in general. Trickery can hide Silent
        arts more easily; you only need Trickery equal to the observer’s Mystery
        instead of needing higher.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are in Rapport with someone, you notice all the magic they do, even
        if it is Silent.

        Intent does not provide skill. Without expertise in civil engineering,
        conjuring a bridge over a mighty river will make nothing but a shambles, the
        wrong size and the wrong type, stone and wood held in place by will and
        concentration. Once that concentration lapses, the bridge will likely
        collapse immediately. Healing done without the Healer profession will close
        wounds and cure disease, but the work will be slow and fraught with
        uncertainty as the healer works against their patient’s own body instead of
        with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For short-term patches, Nature alone may suffice. For longer-term work, one
        needs a professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is especially true when working in the Mystery-nature. Everyone can
        perceive the flow, but people without the Scholar profession may not know
        how to interpret the more subtle details.
      </p>

    <h3 id="mystic_infrastructure">Mystical Support Infrastructure</h3>

    <p>
      At Nature 1 or 2, magic can be done (inefficiently, inaccurately, and poorly)
      by naked intent and sheer force of will. It can be done better with a
      Tradition, but you don't need one. Above Nature 2, you need a Tradition. That
      doesn't mean that everyone needs a tutor to reach Nature 3. Instead, everyone
      who learns on their own builds their own Tradition as they go, focusing on
      what works for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone can reach Nature 3 without external support. Nature scores of 4+
      indicate some form of mystical support built into the body, mind, and/or soul.
      When you read “People with Nature 4 or 5 can accomplish X”, you should imagine
      that it always says “...with the proper support” afterward. Most magi carry
      the support they need with them, but this can be damaged or stripped from them
      by Complications.
    </p>

    <h3 id="pay_magic">Paying For Magic</h3>

    <p>
      The magical arts that you have chosen as your Core Expressions can be used
      freely, assuming there is enough flow available. This is also true of the
      Universal Expressions that all sentient beings know.
    </p>
    <p>
      When casting a spell outside of your Core Expressions you must spend a point
      of Reserve. If you don’t have the Reserve, treat switching as a Moderate
      Advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people know more than one Tradition. Since each one has its own mindset
      and tools, it takes substantial effort to change between them on the fly. In
      game terms, <strong>it costs a point of Reserve to switch which Tradition you
        currently have active.</strong> You may also have to
      <a href="#switching_traditions">adjust your total Reserve and Import</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="cost">All Things Have A Cost</h3>

    <p>
      Magic has a cost. The easiest way to pay this cost is by focusing the flow or
      by running it through a sort of mystical generator that extracts energy and
      leaves the flow somehow changed. When there is not enough flow available,
      there are other ways to pay, with one's mind, body, and soul, but eventually
      these run out as well. Just as there are stories of people running themselves
      to death, there are people who have used so much magic that it killed them,
      immortality notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      To simulate this in game terms, characters with no flow available can use a
      point of Reserve as if it were a large amount of flow, aspected in any way
      that seems appropriate to their Founts. If they are out of Reserve, Advantages
      can yield flow as well. Minor Advantages provide small amounts of aspected
      flow, Moderate Advantages provide moderate flow, Major Advantages provide
      large amounts of flow, and Critical Advantages provide tremendous amounts of
      flow. As always, if you need more Twists, you can take Complications to get
      them. These most often represent wounds, but they might also represent strain
      to the soul, or perhaps debts to supernatural entities to which you pledge a
      geas in exchange for power.
    </p>
    <p>
      It used to be that even learning magic had a cost, with greater learning and
      power exacting a heavier price. This is no longer true: Aion has paid this
      cost for all who have the Gift. What price Aion paid for this, no one knows.

  <section class="subchapter" title="Paths" epub:type="chapter">
    <h2 id="paths">Paths</h2>

    <p>
      A Path is a set of mechanisms that use flow to create or activate mystical
      effects. Each description below includes the hallmarks that people typically
      associate with that sort of magic, and some mechanisms that are commonly used
      to make this Path's magic more reliable, more powerful, and more accessible.
      Some Paths also provide a particular advantage (usually the ability to work
      magic without tools), but at a cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Paths below are not the only ones possible, just a large set of examples.
      It should be easy for players or GMs to invent new Paths or adapt existing
      ones.
    </p>

    <section class="path_description" title="Artistry">

      </div>

      <h3 id="Artistry">Artistry</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Music, song, painting, poetry, tarot cards,
        architecture, tattoos, rare pigments, colors no mortal eye can see, perfect
        pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Specially-stacked decks of cards, nation-sized
        mosaics, murals that paint more of themselves, choruses of automata, paintings
        of the Canon Forms, lutes with strings of silver or of braided mystical
        metals, gemstone xylophones, sheet music that plays symphonies, body
        modification to make one more archetypal, voice amplification, arcane
        blueprints, burnt images, graven idols.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong> When artisans conjure physical objects,
        they can embellish them with artistic flourishes as they desire, or
        even create full-fledged works of art (to the extent of their skills).
        They can also forge mystic connections with the creator of a work of art.

      <h3 id="Belief">Belief</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Love, hate, discipline, adherence, passion, faith,
        meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantage:</strong> Those who walk the path of Belief have no need for
        physical tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Each Tradition must be tied to a single Core
        Value. The believer's maximum Natures are equal to the CV + 2. If the CV
        drops, any Natures higher than the new value + 2 will drop to that rating. In
        addition, Traditions tied to Belief cannot produce magical Expressions that
        are counter to that CV. They can still be used for neutral purposes, but a
        pacifist could not use this Path to kill, and a believer in freedom could not
        confine someone with their magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Mental self-conditioning, mind mazes that trap
        mental curses, hypnotic contingencies, reminders of key moments or people,
        relics created at moments of peak zeal, books of philosophy, mantras that
        fortify devotion, mutually reinforcing belief structures.

      <h3 id="Blood_Magic">Blood Magic</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Blood and flesh, spittle, symbols drawn or carved,
        scarification, exhaustion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantage:</strong> Those who walk the path of Blood Magic have no
        need for physical tools. They can also forge a mystic connection with someone
        using their blood, flesh, or bone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> You've only got so much blood. Magic below your
        Nature doesn't use it up, but magic at your full Nature level does, and it can
        exhaust you more quickly than other Paths. If you want more power, you need
        more people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Cloth woven from or stained with blood,
        accessories made from hardened “bloodstone” gems, different creatures' blood
        for specific purposes, refining the components of the blood, stasis fields to
        preserve flesh, the movement of trade along roads mimicking arteries, knives
        that don't just cut but also store.

      <p>
        <strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Calisthenics, martial arts, yoga, breathing
        exercises, muscle control, balance, mathematical tricks, mnemonics,
        concentration, focused minds.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantage:</strong> Those who walk the path of Discipline have no need
        for physical tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Without maintenance, perfection fades. Choose
        body or mind when you start to walk this Path. Those who walk this Path must
        be able to dedicate an hour each day to practice of the appropriate type, or
        they will see their Nature scores fade at the rate of one level per week. To
        exercise the body, one must be unrestrained. To exercise the mind, one must
        have few distractions. In both cases, one must have appropriate rest, which in
        some cases may be just a few minutes per day. Atrophied Natures return at the
        rate of one point every three days of proper exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Weighted clothing, singing meditation bowls,
        massage techniques, exercise manuals, books of challenging mental problems,
        carefully designed regimens, time accelerators (to practice more quickly),
        teamwork techniques, sympathetic motion to stir nearby elements, splitting the
        mind, training automata, incense that clears the mind, foods that purify the
        body.

      <p>
        <strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Patterns, diagrams, architecture, inscriptions,
        tattoos, geometric shapes, inlaid stones.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong> When conjuring objects from the Canon of
        Form, geometer-mages can create them to a larger or smaller scale, within the
        restrictions of their Industry-nature. For instance, if they conjure an
        ordinary wagon but need a larger one fitted for godly steeds, they can scale
        up the wagon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Tattoos, etchings on the bones and teeth,
        mystical paintings on one's shadow, strangely-shaped towers and basements,
        unexpectedly efficient road patterns, the rearranging of rivers and ley lines,
        clothing embroidered with patterns or equations, ropes knotted in mystical
        patterns, fractal shapes with thousands of tricks hidden deep within.

      <p>
        <strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Spoken and written spells, chants and songs,
        hand-signs, runes, repetition, presentation, retracing the holy paths in word
        and deed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantage:</strong> Those who walk the path of Language can create
        expressions of their Natures with voice or gesture alone, even if separated
        from their tools. Language practitioners can cast spells without tools as if
        their Natures were one point lower.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Words and gestures of power call attention to
        the caster. All magic done without tools becomes
        <a href="#descriptors">Loud</a>
        during its casting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Mystic automata that chant hosannas, spell
        scripts tattooed on the body, hair braided into hieroglyphs, fingernails that
        grow “spell sentences” that you can combine, coded freckles.

      <p>
        <strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Eyes from the shadows, materials pleasing to the
        patron, horns and shells that carry their voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantage:</strong> When called, Patrons can act through their
        petitioners without the need for channeling devices. Those who walk the path
        of the Patron can cast spells without tools as if their Natures were one point
        lower.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Reverence is connection. Creatures from the
        Worlds Beyond can touch the Kaleidoscope in places where they are treated as
        powerful. In places where the patron is unknown or unrespected by locals,
        practitioners do not regain the usual one point of Reserve each night while
        sleeping (though they still do if engaged in a Project).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Holy markings on objects or on the body,
        fragments of the patron as possessing spirits, multiple spirits overlapping to
        provide complex power patterns, networks of patrons to cover more area,
        endless chains of worship.

        potions, solutions, precious metals, compounds, jars, purity, rarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantages:</strong> When conjuring objects from the Canon of
        Form, reagent-using magi can substitute a symbolically-related type of flow
        for the kind that would normally be needed. One would ordinarily use fire-flow
        to create a burning torch, but they could also create one from a companion's
        rage, or from the vision-aspect of a lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Enhanced hair, sweat, and spit, rituals that
        transmute reagents as you harvest them, hollow bones and teeth, pockets in the
        body, “everlasting” reagents embedded in bone, micropatterns of common
        reagents that emulate a rare one, transmuting stable reagents into volatile
        forms just before use.

      <h3 id="Wild_Magic">Wild Magic</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Hallmarks:</strong> Wild mages collect bits of extraneous power from
        the world, and do magic using the conflicts and confluences between that
        ephemera, the aspects of nearby flow, and their own Natures. Things both
        appropriate and ironic can arise in these situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantage:</strong> Those who walk the path of Wild Magic manifest
        their power in cascades of harmony and dissonance with the local environment.
        They can cast spells without tools as if their Natures were one point lower.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Odd effects abound near a practitioner of wild
        magic each time they express their Natures. Most of these are equivalent to
        Trivial or Minor Complications, but it makes them easy to identify and follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Mechanisms:</strong> Probability deregulators, randomness enhancers,
        brownian motion engines, aspect enhancers, strings whose knots capture
        snippets of strongly aspected flow, aspect prisms to separate flow into
        finer-grained concepts.

    <section class="path_description" title="Universal Tools">

      <h3 id="Universal_Tools">Universal Tools</h3>

      <p>Some things are widely-used magical tools rather than being Paths.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Calendar magic</strong>, using events related to the sun, moon, stars, and holidays,
        can generate aspected flow and can also be used to do magic. However, waiting
        until a particular day to create a particular magical effect is too limiting
        in this day and age. These events are typically more useful as an occasional
        boost of power.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sympathetic magic</strong> is extremely common, thanks to the Gift's metaphysical
        preference for poetic events. Sympathy is essentially parallel construction in
        mystical form. A Necromancer casting curses pierces a doll to harm the person
        the doll was made to resemble. An adept of Earthpower moving rock and stone
        will likely be making motions in matching directions. An Elementalist placing
        a model of a building into an ice bath would expect the building to cool down
        if they so directed their power.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Relics</strong> are magical items that are linked to a particular individual, to help
        them channel flow. They are used by many different Paths, from an artist's
        favored paintbrush to a geometer's perfect t-square to the ritual knives of
        blood magic. Relics are not expended after use but are hard to replace, as
        opposed to reagents, which are replaceable and expendable.

    <h2 id="founts">Founts</h2>

    <p>
      Founts are the sources of magic, from which pour infinite expressions of
      power. Each one provides a broad category of mystical effects, many of which
      overlap with other Founts. For each one we describe:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>principles</strong> on which it operates. Sometimes two Founts may operate on the

        The <strong>manifestations</strong> of that Fount – descriptions of the typical effects that

        effects for any particular combination of Founts and Paths. Feel free to
        mix-and-match without restriction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most Founts have <strong>unique limitations</strong> – sometimes a specific Expression they
        are banned from using, sometimes a broader set of restrictions.

    <aside title="Conceptually Fuzzy">
      <h3 id="conc_fuzz">Conceptually Fuzzy</h3>
      <p>
        Paths, Founts, Natures, and professions are not well-separated ideas. You
        will find pieces of the Reagents path in the Alchemy fount, and pieces of
        the Mystery-nature in the Scholar profession. Don't expect them to be
        perfectly clean and distinct.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <h3 id="create_fount">Creating your own Fount</h3>

    <p>
      As with Paths, it is possible for players and GMs to create new Founts. It
      takes a little more work to make a Fount than it does to make a Path, so we
      present this example: the creation process for the Elementalism Fount. Let’s
      walk through it as if we were a player building this Fount.
    </p>
    <p>
      We initially conceive of Elementalism as a Fount that draws on the classical
      four elements (air, earth, fire, and water). It should be a very physical
      Fount, with lots of showy Expressions and loud power. The classical elements
      also have metaphorical connotations (fire is boisterous energy, water is
      adaptable and emotional, etc.) that will be helpful when we're dealing with
      Communion, Mystery, and Self. Our GM suggests adding a fifth element to
      connect with flow and the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before starting, we consider whether an existing Fount can be slightly tweaked
      to make what we're looking for. Alchemy is probably the closest, but it has a
      distinctly different feel – more laboratories and tomes, less ice storms and
      volcanoes. Earthpower would give us ice storms and volcanoes, but we don't
      want the explicit connection to living things. Elementalism might have fire
      ants, but they're ants made of actual fire. (This choice also helps us rule
      out “Life” as a fifth element.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've made sure that there's enough conceptual space for your Fount, the
      next thing to consider is the principles by which it operates. A Fount with
      just one or two principles will be very simple, making it either too limited
      or too powerful. A Fount with a dozen principles will typically lack any
      conceptual cohesion.
    </p>
    <p>We test out a few ideas for the principles of Elementalism:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Everything is made of the elements. This gives us a hook into basically
        every physical object.
      </li>
      <li>The more complex something is, the harder it is to work with.</li>
      <li>
        Do we want an oppositional approach (fire vs water, earth vs air) or do we
        want a rock-paper-scissors-style cycle of dominance? Is either of these
        necessary?
      </li>
      <li>
        Our GM suggests that a cycle of dominance might also give us a way to turn
        one element into another – dumping Earth-aspected flow into a waterfowl
        might overwhelm its Air aspect and turn it into a toad.
      </li>
      <li>
        The emotional connotations of our elements should probably be an explicit
        principle.
      </li>
      <li>
        If elements have emotions attached to them, maybe everything is made of
        elements, including thoughts and feelings. There's no separate mental
        domain. Everything is a physical thing.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Eventually we leave out the explicit cycle of dominance, as well as the idea
      of complexity making things difficult (because our GM tells us that's tough to
      judge on the fly). We keep the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing down manifestations is the fun part. We throw in not just attack
      spells, but mental powers, interesting stunts, and things like genies and
      elemental beings. (Sorcerously Advanced is the kind of setting where players
      can invent things like that and be fairly confident that they'll fit in
      somewhere, somehow.) It's also around here that we decide that darkness should
      be the fifth element.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Arts, Elementalism should definitely share Alchemy's talent for
      transmutation. Earthpower's ability to manipulate the Canon of Form would be
      interesting – we could make things that are normally one element out of
      another (like a frozen flame or a wall of solid air). We talk to our GM about
      something that lets us overpower other wizards when it comes to purely
      elemental things, but they disagree – Founts generally don't provide those
      kinds of mechanical bonuses. All in all we end up with around a dozen
      different arts that will be available to practitioners of Elementalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, good limitations make for interesting powers. While we've talked
      about the emotional resonances of various elements, Elementalism is still a
      physical Fount first and foremost. It's probably going to need physical
      connections in order to work.

      You can see the completed Elementalism fount <a href="#Elementalism">below</a>. It includes a list
      of suggested Paths, which is something that a GM should consider during the
      creation process but not something a player needs to spend time on.

      <h3 id="Alchemy">Alchemy</h3>

      <h4>Principles</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Matter/Spirit Dualism.</strong> The physical can reflect and move
          the spiritual. They can be connected and disconnected; both can be distilled
          and refined; both can be transmuted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inherent Symbolism.</strong> Materials and forms have reliable
          meanings regardless of their use. Using or transmuting those materials, and
          manipulating those shapes, works magic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Harmony.</strong> Harmonious combination is the path to power and
          enlightenment. Sometimes when two things cannot be combined, introducing a
          third will allow harmony. Dissonance destroys magical effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mathematics.</strong> Formulae can describe our world and its
          processes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Manifestations</h4>

      <p>
        Formulae, amulets, automata, clockworks, miniaturization, alterations of
        matter, changes in the self, changing one's flesh into inorganic matter,
        machines that alter or affect spirits, spiritual changes that affect the
        physical world, rebalancing the humors, reaching in and out of the Canon of
        Form, shared transformation, forensics, calculation engines, flow condensers,
        transmutation, explosions, gasses, toughened bodies and skins, antivenom,
        hallucinogens.
      </p>

      <h4>Typical Arts and Paths</h4>

      <p>
        Cloning, Deconjuration, Hallucination, Mnemosurgery, Precognition,
        Psychometry, Shapeshifting, the Shell Game, Tailored Canon, Transmutation,
        Transcendence
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paths:</strong> Reagents, Blood Magic, and Language are common. Belief
        and Patrons are rare.
      </p>

      <h4>Unique Limitation</h4>

      <p>
        Spirit-walking. Alchemy is too physically grounded an art, and too proud of
        its spiritual manifestations. Its spirits shine with inner radiance.
        Alchemists can go unnoticed or go in an immaterial form, but not both.

      <h3 id="Arete">Arete</h3>

      <h4>Principles</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-Control.</strong> One can control only the self, not others or
          the world.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>All are One.</strong> All who received the Gift are a single being
          realizing its unity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seeking Perfection.</strong> Perfection is unattainable, but seeking
          it continuously empowers the seeker.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Action Without Effort.</strong> The harder one tries in the moment,
          the more one stands in one's own way. Effort is good for training; execution
          should be effortless. Calm is the key to effectiveness.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Manifestations</h4>

      <p>
        Martial technique, meditative states, mathematical skill, extending the mind
        via eye contact or skin-to-skin contact, physical strength, impossible
        acrobatics, mnemonic techniques, wound absorption, massage, hypercognition and
        focused mental states, walking in silence, giving no tell, forensics, reading
        body language, fortune and misfortune, leverage, pressure points, method
        acting, striking, archaic weapons.
      </p>

      <h4>Typical Arts and Paths</h4>

      <p>
        The Burning Dream, Curses, Dream travel, Expanded expertise, Guising,
        Hypnopraxis, Lagged curses, Multitasking, Null tolerance, Personae,
        Psychometry, Precognition, Soul-work, Telekinesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paths:</strong> Discipline, Belief, and Reagents are common. Artistry
        and Wild Magic are rare.
      </p>

      <h4>Unique Limitation</h4>

      <p>
        You cannot affect things outside of yourself and your immediate gaze. This is
        mostly a change to the types of Complications you can give or take in a
        conflict, but it also prevents you from creating long-term autonomous effects
        that can leave your line of sight. You can use long-distance arts when you
        have an appropriate connection, but it must be formed through Core Values with
        yourself or with a person, not with an object or location.

      <h3 id="Earthpower">Earthpower</h3>

      <h4>Principles</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Seek Respect Over Power.</strong> Living in harmony with spirits and
          with the Basin itself is the path to enlightenment. Seeking power is the
          path to destruction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Greatest Path is Life's.</strong> Many of Earthpower's abilities
          mimic natural events and cycles, but in ways that are faster, stronger,
          harsher, or carefully controlled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inherent Symbolism.</strong> Plants, animals, and minerals have
          reliable meanings regardless of their use. Using them works magic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You Reap What You Sow.</strong> Those who are kind will have a life
          of kindness. Those who are warlike will have a life of war.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Manifestations</h4>

      <p>
        Plants, animals, weather, volcanism, spirit guides and tutors, animal forms,
        heal from the spirit outward, speaking to the world, shared experience,
        healing clay, seeing balance and imbalance, ground swallowing or disgorging
        evidence, walking without trace, seeds and fruit, mimicking nature, inner
        strength, shared strength, parental authority, regeneration, lightning,
        meteors
      </p>

      <h4>Typical Arts and Paths</h4>

      <p>
        Cloning, Curses, Expanded Expertise, Guising, Multitasking, Nature-work,
        Precognition, Psychometry, Shapeshifting, Tailored Canon, Weather-work
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paths:</strong> Reagents, Belief, and Patrons are common. Geometry and
        Discipline are rare.
      </p>

      <h4>Unique Limitations</h4>

      <p>
        Perhaps the Red Space is too otherworldly. Perhaps it is too abstract, or too
        dangerous. Certainly it is poisonous to the individual and to the environment.
        Whatever the reason, Earthpower cannot open the Red Space.
      </p>

      </div>

      <h3 id="Elementalism">Elementalism</h3>

      <h4>Principles</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Foundations of All.</strong> Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Void
          are the things from which everything is made. Some places in the Basin refer
          to Void as Darkness, Shadow, or Soul instead, but it is the same element in
          all places.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inherent Symbolism.</strong> Materials and forms have reliable
          meanings regardless of their use. Using or transmuting those materials, and
          manipulating those shapes, works magic. Not all elementalists agree on what
          the symbolism is, though.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>All Things Change.</strong> Nothing remains what it is forever.
          Everything flows through the myriad cycles of the Ten Thousand Forms. Magic
          can forestall or accelerate that change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>All Things are Physical.</strong> There is no true division between
          the body, the world, the mind, and the soul. Altering the physical world can
          evoke changes in the mental world, and vice versa.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Manifestations</h4>

      <p>
        Elementals, elementally-aspected beasts, genies, hypnotic flames, vapors that
        grant visions, crystals that heal, ice that never melts, elemental forms,
        rarified air, seeing elemental balance, transmutation, essence flows,
        telekinesis, conjuration, shunting assaults into the void, fireballs, ice
        storms, poison gas, walls of rock or wind
      </p>

      <h4>Typical Arts and Paths</h4>

      <p>
        Deconjuration, Hallucination, Multitasking, Shapeshifting, the Shell Game,
        Tailored Canon, Telekinesis, Transmutation, Transcendence, Weather-work
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paths:</strong> Language, Geometry, Reagents, Patrons, and Wild Magic
        are common. Blood Magic is rare.
      </p>

      <h4>Unique Limitations</h4>

      <p>
        Elementalism is the least spiritual of the Founts. While each element has
        emotional associations, disciples of elementalism have difficulty with
        anything that lacks a connection to the physical world. When they go
        spirit-walking, they do so as wind, not as a dream or shadow. When they seek
        Rapport with someone, they must have a physical (not just emotional)
        connection with that someone, such as carrying fragments of the same crystal
        or being related by blood.

      </div>

      <h3 id="Glory">Glory</h3>

      <h4>Principles</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rejoice in the Ultimate.</strong> Power is discovered in intensity
          and purity, in heights and depths – not in an uncertain or muddled middle
          ground.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow the Mighty.</strong> It is by emulating those who came before
          that we understand ourselves and our power. Acting in the manner of an
          archetype gives you strength and guidance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>All are One.</strong> All who received the Gift are a single being
          realizing its unity. Your soul can speak to the souls of others in a way
          they cannot ignore.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Imbued Symbolism.</strong> Materials, shapes, and phenomena have
          meanings as assigned by their use. Working within that symbolism reinforces
          it, which both works magic and enhances future magic. Working against the
          symbolism causes dangerous accidents and weakens future magic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>There Is A Plan.</strong> Aion's plan for the universe can be seen,
          heard, and acted on.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h4>Manifestations</h4>

      <p>
        Light, darkness, auras, bells and chimes, singing, chanting, faith healing,
        laying on hands, talking to gods and devils, epiphany, guidance, blessings,
        dark gifts, commands, mystic servitors, speaking to the soul, igniting power,
        spiritual shields that defend the soul, glowing shields, flaming swords,
        damaging shouts, awe and authority.
      </p>

      <h4>Typical Arts and Paths</h4>

      <p>
        Curses, Dream travel, Dreamshaping, Expanded Expertise, Hallucination,
        Hypnopraxis, Lagged Curses, Nightmare Exile, Psychometry, Shapeshifting,
        Soul-work
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paths:</strong> Belief, Patrons, and Language are common. Reagents and
        Geometry are rare.
      </p>

      <h4>Unique Limitations</h4>

      <p>
        Disciples of Glory must choose between the arts of
        <a href="#Distillation">Distillation</a> and
        the arts of the <a href="#the_shroud">Shroud</a>. They can bring purity, or they can hide
        themselves away, but not both. Characters are allowed to know two Glory-based
        Traditions and choose differently in each.

      <h4>Principles</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>All Souls are One.</strong> Every soul can speak to the souls of
          others in a way they cannot ignore.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Death is Universal.</strong> Once you accept the death within you,
          you can influence all things through the death within them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Matter/Spirit Dualism.</strong> The spiritual can reflect and move
          the physical. They can be connected and disconnected; both can be distilled
          and refined. While matter can change, the spirit remains eternal.
        </li>

          <strong>Imbued Symbolism.</strong> Materials, shapes, and phenomena have

        Ghosts, skeletons, zombies, shadows, bones, disease, poison, trances, spirit
        advisors, tragedy, fear, sadness, pulling death, ghost stories, soul-melding,

        <strong>Paths:</strong> Blood Magic, Language, Reagents, and Geometry are
        common. Belief and Discipline (body) are rare.
      </p>

      <h4>Unique Limitations</h4>

      <p>
        Necromantic use of the Healing art is fragile. It instills patients with
        artificial strength or uncanny mental stability. Individuals “healed” this way
        use their internal health-flow powering this vigor, and have none left to
        magically regenerate themselves. They must be healed by another or allow their
        body to heal itself the long way. Necromancers can still regenerate themselves
        just fine.

      <h4>Principles</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Mind is More Real.</strong> The physical world of the Basin is
          only where life began. The Dream Worlds are the true source of power and
          meaning in the universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Power Arises from Story.</strong> Archetypes, motifs, rising action,
          dramatic reversals – these things are the root of meaning. Using them or
          subverting them does magic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Matter/Spirit Dualism.</strong> The spiritual can reflect and move
          the physical. They can be connected and disconnected; both can be distilled

          <strong>All Things Change.</strong> Nothing remains what it is forever. The
          world and its stories change us all. Magic can influence those changes.
        </li>

        Shapeshifting, Transcendence
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paths:</strong> Artistry, Belief, and Wild Magic are common. Blood
        Magic, Geometry, and Discipline (either) are rare.
      </p>

      <h4>Unique Limitations</h4>

      <p>
        Oneiromancy is very limited in its ability to affect the world outside of the
        Dream Realms. Its energy waves are psychic, its mystic defenders more phantasm
        than force. In order to have large-scale effects on the physical world, an
        Oneiromancer must call creatures from the dream worlds to do this work for
        them, which can be somewhat more time-consuming, less precise, and more
        frightening for bystanders than other Founts' methods. In addition,
        Expressions of Industry create illusions or call shimmering shapes and
        simulacra from dream worlds. These could never be mistaken for natural
        objects. (Illusions created via Trickery can still fool others.)

    <aside title="Childhood and Inherent Magic">
      <h3 id="child_magic">Childhood and Inherent Magic</h3>
      <p>
        Infants in the Basin thankfully cannot throw Energy Waves or access the
        Travel lattice. Children are born with no magical abilities except
        Sovereignty. Around age 5 they start instinctively accessing the art of
        Becoming. If they are taught well, most can develop the Sixth Sense around
        age 7, and True Speech by 9 or 10.
      </p>
      <p>
        People develop the other Universal Expressions as they mature, depending on
        their own strengths and interests. By age 20, the vast majority of
        individuals have awakened Distillation, Enchantment, Rapport, the Shroud,
        and Terror, and have some degree of Mental Acuity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immortality is special. Each culture teaches its own method at its own pace.
        People who are not taught a specific art (and who are not in a Returner
        cult) tend to figure it out around age 50, if their Self score is high
        enough. This can happen sooner under traumatic circumstances.

        Different sects of elementalists often disagree as to what a particular

        Here are some options for your game.

    <h2 id="arts">The Arts of Magic</h2>

    <p>
      The Great Basin is at a transition point when it comes to the magical arts.
      Magic before the Gift was an intensely personal pursuit, the playground of the
      lucky and powerful. Since its democratization, magic on a personal level has
      been developed to the outer edges of individual capability. If magic is to be
      further developed, it must be through teamwork and communal support.
    </p>
    <p>In other words, to become more powerful, magic must become a technology.</p>
    <p>
      There are indications that this has happened before. Many scholars look
      suspiciously at the Travel Lattice and the Ten-Crore Stones, believing them to
      be artifacts of once-vast mystical infrastructure. What happened to their
      builders? How is it that these things remain when so many others have faded?
    </p>
    <p>
      The construction of such vast mystic edifice is still out of the Basin’s
      reach, but not for long. Dozens of civilizations are reaching the point of a
      magic-fueled industrial revolution. Magic cannot become science – but it can
      create technology. Until that not-so-far-off day, magic is still a collection
      of spells, arts, rituals, and tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section describes the mystic arts that are most central and most common
      in the Basin. Most of the arts listed here are categories of techniques that
      express part of one’s Nature, but some entries are for a single spell or
      ancient mystical technology.
    </p>

    <h3 id="manifesting">Manifesting the Arts</h3>

    <p>
      The arts listed below can manifest in a wide variety of different ways. Each
      Tradition will have its own particular methods of healing, shapeshifting,
      conjuring, etc. Examples are given in several cases. Few mystic arts are the
      kind of thing that one does simply by closing one’s eyes and wishing. Incense
      must be burned, oracle bones must be consulted, the proper mental state must
      be attained, and then (and only then) can magic be done. Even wild magic and
      Arete require a process by which they work.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the proper approach has been employed, the process is not yet over.
      Emotionally aspected flow impacts one's emotional state. Arts that are
      well-tested and carefully-designed will restore their user's emotional state
      to what it was before use, but experimental devices and techniques will leave
      a resonance in their user that takes a bit of time to clear. Improvised
      techniques are the most likely to leave side-effects behind, and might trigger
      the <a href="Rules.xhtml#worst_enemy">Worst Enemy Rule</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="arts_game_terms">Arts in Game Terms</h3>

    <p>Each Expression lists the following items:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Nature:</strong> The Nature that this art expresses.
      Sometimes a minimum requred score is indicated (e.g. War 4+).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Type:</strong> Whether the art is Universal (available to everyone),
      Common (taught by all cultures), Restricted (not taught to all), or a Grand
      Wonderwork (ancient magical technology).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Descriptors:</strong> Descriptors are categories for arts that have additional game
      mechanics effects, or game-world effects that are particularly worthy of note.
      See below for a full list of descriptors and their effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Flow:</strong> How much flow is required to invoke this art? As a reminder, the scale
      is: Minimal, Small, Moderate, Large, Tremendous.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Side Effects:</strong> The arts of magic are powerful, and even proper use can
      sometimes have dangers.
    </p>

    <h3 id="descriptors">Descriptor List</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Access:</strong> This technique does not truly use the caster's own
        flow or expertise. Instead, it uses those only to grant access to a piece of
        omnipresent sorcerous technology. Most of these described below are ancient
        technologies that have survived into the present day, but many civilizations
        are building their own public goods to rival these.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connection:</strong> This Expression requires a
        <a href="#mystic_connections">mystic connection</a>
        to use. Without the connection, it fails.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ex Nihilo:</strong> This Expression creates physical material or
        tangible things from the flow or from nothing at all.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inheritable:</strong> This Expression, and perhaps the work done by
        it, will pass on to all of the character’s children born after it is
        acquired.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loud / Silent:</strong> “Loud” arts are particularly easy to detect.
        They broadcast their presence. Characters do not need to search for loud
        magic; it is immediately obvious. Not all loud effects are high-decibel sound.
        Silent arts are practically impossible to detect at work; one must
        intentionally search for each silent art separately to detect it (a slow
        process). Silent Expressions are low-footprint in all ways, including sound.
        See the sidebar on <a href="#detect_magic">detecting the use of magic</a>
        for more detail.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nonphysical:</strong> Most often applied to arts of War, Expressions
        with this Descriptor do not act through the physical world of bodies and
        elements. Attacks with this Descriptor cannot be blocked by solid matter
        unless it is enchanted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reliable:</strong> Ritual arts marked with this descriptor have been
        polished and refined over millennia. Their effects are not prone to flaws or
        malfunctions the way most rituals are.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ritual:</strong> Some arts cannot be activated quickly or easily, and
        must be accomplished using the <a href="Rules.xhtml#rituals">Ritual</a> rules.
        Unless otherwise specified, these are Craft Rituals with minimum Profession 2. The minimum
        Nature is either 2 or the minimum nature for the art in question. This
        descriptor is not included for techniques that use just a quick ritual (say, 5
        minutes or less), only those that require substantial outlay of time and
        resources. Note that most rituals create prototypes: functional, but
        unpolished and faulty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Uncast:</strong> This is not a spell to be cast, but a truth, action,
        or manner of being that is magic. Arts with the Uncast descriptor can be
        activated without the need for any external support, including
        specially-aspected flow, magical connections, or supporting arts. There is no
        way to keep a conscious person from using them.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="side_effects">The Side Effects of the Arts</h3>

    <p>
      In the same way that science-based technology (at a minimum) requires energy
      and creates heat, magical arts have their own issues. Many of these are more
      acute and widespread than pollution is in SA, because magic is a newer
      phenomenon here than science is there. The dangers listed below are only just
      being recognized in some places.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Flow Depletion.</strong> High-tech nations and cities sometimes stall large amounts
        of the flow. This leads to Null Zones “downstream” from that location.
        Individuals rarely use enough flow to deplete their local area, but it can
        happen in Null Zones or when dealing with the Red Space.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chaotic Flow.</strong> Sometimes flow picks up a complex mix of differing, possibly
        contradictory aspects that make it dangerous to use. Practitioners of wild
        magic seek this out; others carefully avoid it. Chaotic flow can be used in
        place of nearly any aspect (except ones like “calm” or “well-ordered”), but
        the results will be unpredictable and difficult to manage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Warped Flow.</strong> When a country or city needs vast quantities of
        specifically-aspected flow, that flow still moves rimward afterward, holding
        its new aspect. The next people toward the edge of the Basin may not want
        their flow aspected that way. Individuals rarely warp enough flow to
        inconvenience others, but it may cling to them and result in a change of
        <a href="CharGen.xhtml#earthlyform">Earthly Form</a> from Balanced to Aspected.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emotional Fatigue.</strong> High art needs to align Natures and Core Values when
        creating powerful effects. When done properly, the device returns these to
        their original states, but the mental strain can be severe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Emotional Burn-in.</strong> Many people who overuse their arts feel uncomfortably
        “stuck” in a particular Nature and its corresponding emotional states, and
        have trouble getting out of it. There is some disconcerting evidence that
        this also happens on the national level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chakra occlusion.</strong> Certain techniques that alter the self temporarily, like
        shapeshifting and enchantment, prioritize one effect over all others.
        Personal flow is diverted to maintain that effect alone, making it difficult
        to use other sophisticated arts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These issues come up during game play when the GM or players decide to invoke
      them. They make excellent fodder for Complications, Advantages, and use of the
      <a href="Rules.xhtml#worst_enemy">Worst Enemy Rule</a>. Temporary CVs are an excellent Complication to
      use. The only side effect that has explicit, fixed game effects is chakra
      occlusion, the effects of which are described in each individual art with that
      side effect.

        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Universal</li>

      <p>
        Perhaps the most treasured aspect of the Gift is that every person, slowly,
        becomes who and what they most strongly feel and desire themselves to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming is how the Ægis became gods and angels. It's how old Cultists slip
        into being ghosts, and Peacewalkers rid themselves of violent thoughts. It's
        how accidents of birth are corrected or embraced, and how life-changing
        decisions are made manifest on oneself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming requires no rituals, and practically zero flow. One simply holds
        beliefs and desires, and the body and mind change to fit. One does not need to
        take actions in order to Become, though associating with like-minded
        individuals or taking actions that reinforce one's chosen identity can aid the
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Becoming is gradual. If one is not deep in the Self-nature, it can take years.
        If pushed, it still takes weeks, at the cost of side effects and potential
        backsliding. For faster changes to oneself that snap back once the flow is
        released, see <a href="#shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</a>.
        <a href="#Healing">Healing</a> can also
        accelerate the act of Becoming, but this is more common when the person being
        healed is not deep in the Self-nature.
      </p>
      <p>This is the primary art of the Self-nature.</p>

        Conflict in the Dream Realms are normally conducted using Communion, Mystery,
        or Trickery. Practitioners of the Burning Dream may also use Industry or War.
        When acting against sleeping opponents, they can inflict Complications that
        affect their opponent’s body (not just their mind).

        Conjuration normally produces objects or creatures from the

        Those who have learned the art of cloning may, instead, choose to
        create duplicates from samples – growing a pine tree from a cone or making a
        deer from shed antlers. The larger and more complex the original, the longer
        the ritual to replicate it.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Craft Ritual:</strong> Most hand-held objects, insects or fish, and
          small plants.

          <strong>Minor Ritual:</strong> Trees, most unintelligent animals,

        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Cloning is most often done with living beings, where uniqueness is
        particularly valued. Not many people clone chairs. Living beings do not retain
        memories, and cloned books, tablets, scrolls, etc. contain chicken-scratch
        that only resembles writing at first glance. Cloned artwork is uniquely awful.

        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Common</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Descriptors:</strong> Ex Nihilo, sometimes Ritual and Reliable

        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Moderate or more</li>
        <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Warped flow</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Conjuration creates physical things out of the flow, using templates from the
        Canon of Form (below). There are canonical forms for all classes of
        physical objects, from plants and animals to mountains and lakes to buildings
        and autogyros. Low levels of Industry use quick techniques to create small
        nonmagical objects that one could hold in one hand. Higher levels use arrays
        of mystical devices or intricately repeated procedures to create large
        animals, powerful magical artifacts, or even small palaces. Small objects are
        called almost instantly; larger ones can take a few minutes, and complex ones
        can stretch into the range of ritual magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conjuration draws purely from the Canon. The first example of a device, and
        all works of art, must be created by hand. Many artists and engineers use
        conjuration-like methods to slowly sculpt or paint their creations out of
        nothing. The process is not faster than it might otherwise be, it just
        requires no raw materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conjured food is perfectly edible and provides the usual nutrition. The only
        drawback is that the Canon contains a limited repertoire of food items, so
        it's easy to get bored with them. Rather than trading in spices, people hire
        out as spice conjurers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is permitted for magi to conjure parts of objects, either to get at a
        specific piece or to build something one part at a time that you aren't
        capable of conjuring whole.
      </p>

      <aside title="The Canon of Form">
        <h4 id="canon_form">The Canon of Form</h4>
        <p>
          Conjuration does not create objects made to order. Instead, it pulls from a
          catalog known as the Canon of Form. This selection of objects, creatures,
          and archetypes comes in two parts: a personal collection called the
          Signature Canon, and a regional collection known as the Consensus Canon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each person's unique Signature Canon is formed from their own experiences,
          including the culture and family in which they were raised. Your
          grandmother's favorite sweets, the tree you climbed in as a child, and the
          model autogyro you built by hand while learning alchemy all might be in your
          Signature Canon. This Canon is formed most strongly when you are young,
          though it can continue to evolve over your life. It is made of things
          internalized rather than memorized. Adding to the Canon of Form is less like
          reading a cookbook and more like learning to cook via hand-holding and
          practice. Most people have a few hundred items in their Signature, some of
          which are more technical items gained from a Profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each physical region also has a Consensus Canon, formed in the collective
          unconscious of those who live there. It contains those things that locals
          associate with their particular region: the rich zzonga-fruit of the
          Hearth-Kin, the compass and cord that every Geometer student knows, the
          glass-helmed vacuum suits of Those Above. The Consensus Canon holds forms
          for every object and animal for which a civilization has words, but it’s
          only a generic idea of them, not an expert's understanding. If you can't say
          it in just a word or two, you probably can't conjure it. You can get “medium
          wrench”, but it might not be exactly “two and a half centimeter wrench”.
        </p>
        <p>
          You bring your Signature Canon with you wherever you go. Others generally
          cannot access it, though you can share it via
          <a href="#Rapport">Rapport</a> or via
          <a href="#Tailored_Canon">Tailored Canon</a>.
          If you travel to a new region, you gain access to the local
          Consensus. If the Consensus changes (perhaps due to an influx of people or a
          shift in the culture), the things you can conjure changes. Sometimes you
          won't even realize that the world changed around you until you find yourself
          calling forth something other than what you expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Signature Canon overrules the Consensus Canon when you conjure, so long
          as there is actually something appropriate in your personal Canon. If you
          don't remember the taste and smell of your the food from your home well
          enough, you can't conjure it. If there's a judgment call needed as to
          whether you can create something, your CVs and Professions will help the GM
          answer that question.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Consensus is typically uniform across each city-state. Between
          city-states it can change substantially, with dramatic changes between
          civilizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Signature Canon is tied to your
          <a href="#magical_signatures">magical signature</a>.
          Particularly canny or perceptive investigators might discern something about
          one piece of your Signature by examining the other pieces.

      <p>
        With direct mind control made impossible, characters who want to exercise
        control over others without stooping to the level of physical assaults often
        turn to curses: complex twists of fate with a mind of their own that seek to
        harm others and befoul their days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most devotees of the War-nature know dozens of curses for any situation. There
        is the Curse of the Ruptured Purse, which makes people mislay their valuables.
        There is the Butterfoot Curse that makes people slip and fall at painful
        moments. The Kind Stranger's Curse causes one to forget or forgive slights
        against oneself. The Curse of the Invisible Ants causes itching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applying a curse is a Conflict that pits the curse-caster's War against the
        target's War or Self. If the target is aware of the curse (for instance, if
        they see it cast), they can choose to contest it with War instead... but the
        nature of most curses is to hide themselves. No one will fail to notice the
        Curse of the White Eye that makes them go blind, but the Hidden Curtain Curse
        conceals one thing or person from the target until they strike, and that is a
        difficult thing to realize. Because of this, many people choose to apply
        Curses as a <a href="Rules.xhtml#subtle_conflicts">Subtle Conflict</a>. The magic hides itself from the target
        until it runs its course completely, as determined by the Complication
        inflicted. Other observers may notice a curse using Mystery, following the
        normal rules for a Silent art. Curses can be levied at line of sight, or at
        any distance within the same realm of existence if one has a mystic connection
        to the target. Cursing a larger group can be done via ritual, or by using the
        rules for conflict against groups and those with Infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Curses created with War 4 or 5 are not necessarily more powerful than those
        created at War 2 or 3. Brute force is comparatively easy to deflect. Instead,
        high-powered curses are deeper, more devious, and more insidious. Those deeper
        in the War-nature cast curses that are more likely to succeed due to
        repetition, lateral strategies, double-pronged assaults, novel approaches, and
        more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Curses require very little flow to bestow, but they do tap into some local
        flow when they come into effect. Living in a Null Zone is an effective (if
        arduous) way to wait out your curse.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's possible to bestow a Curse That Creeps from someone to their associates,
        virally infecting those closest to them. Treat this as a typical teamwork
        situation, or a large-scale conflict if that's more appropriate. It's
        incredibly difficult to do this while keeping the curse a secret.

      <aside title="Curses Are Not Helpful">
        <h4 id="curses_no_help">Curses Are Not Helpful</h4>
        <p>
          Curses must be malignant. You can't apply a curse that's actually a blessing
          in disguise. They generally don't grant Advantages. It is all but impossible
          to gain any benefits from a curse's effect. Remember: they are living,
          intelligent, malevolent things. They are a portion of the caster's vengeful
          psyche. They will disappear or bide their time if they seem to be doing more
          good than harm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within that broad guideline, however, curses can achieve nearly any baleful
          effect. A general wish of “bad luck” is fine if you're not feeling
          inventive. If you want to get creative, anything that fits the level of the
          Complication is appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain particularly thrill-seeking or reckless groups (e.g. the Sovereigns,
          some Nova cultures) might use series of lagged curses to set up chains of
          events that have a wide variety of effects, sometimes adding together,
          sometimes cancelling out. These experiments frequently end in disaster.

      <p>
        Deconjuration removes matter from the universe at roughly the same rate that
        Conjuration creates it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deconjuration has a place among construction techniques, excavating cellars
        and clearing rubble. When in airtight situations like cave-ins, it's even
        possible to conjure clean air and deconjure excess air, so that there's always
        enough good air to breathe. You could deconjure rocks to tunnel your way out,
        but without some sort of Theurgy or architecture-related Artisan skill you
        risk further collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deconjuration is not particularly useful as an assault unless the target is
        tied down, in which case a knife is just as dangerous. If a Tradition uses a
        disintegration ray as an attack, or calls forth hungry phantasms of oblivion,
        those should be learned as <a href="#Energy_Waves">Energy Waves</a>. Deconjuration does,
        however, aspect much of the local flow toward destruction, which can sometimes
        result in unfortunate conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deconjuration does not, by default, place things into the Canon of Form or
        into a <a href="#Universal_Repositories">Universal Repository</a>.
        Deconjuration also does not provide a flow “refund”.

      </ul>

      <p>
        Everything that is made and shaped in this world takes on aspects according to
        its function and use. Distillation is the process of enhancing or suppressing
        those attributes. With this art mages create perfectly transparent glass, or
        remove its fragility. They make houses that resist hurricanes and provide
        comfort even on the dreariest days. They make tools that work faster, as if
        they were eager for use. They remove cracks from pots, smooth roads, and make
        drinks more potent. Whatever an object is, distillation can make it more so,
        or less.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects small enough to be hefted can be enhanced quickly. Larger ones (such
        as buildings and bridges) should be handled via Ritual.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enhance warlike aspects – a sword’s sharpness, a bow’s reach, a poison’s
        efficacy – see the art of <a href="#Weaponry">Weaponry</a> instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the term “distillation” may bring up images of alchemy, this art is
        inherent to the Gift and is available via all Founts.

        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Universal</li>
        <li><strong>Descriptors:</strong> Connection, Loud, Ritual</li>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Large</li>
        <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Chakra occlusion</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Enchantment is a special kind of ritual where you share your magic with
        someone else for a time. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You're teaching someone else to shapeshift. You change into a hawk and bring
          them with you so that they can see what it feels like.
        </li>
        <li>
          You, with Mystery 5, can see what happened here in the past, but you don't
          have the skill to interpret what you see. Your ally has the necessary
          training, but has a Mystery of 1. You enchant them with your power so they
          can see it with their own eyes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your elemental form shields yourself from the fiery caldera you must cross.
          You infuse your allies with fire flow in order to shield them from it even
          if you get separated.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To enchant someone, start by entering Rapport with them. It doesn't need to be
        a deep sharing, but they need to be willing. You then cast a spell that shares
        your power.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you enchant more people, the effects of chakra occlusion become more
        pronounced. You can always enchant a single person. If you enchant more
        people, your Nature drops: one point for every ten times more people (-1 from
        3 to 10 people, -2 from 11 to 100 people, etc.) Once it drops below the level
        required to use the power in question, you cannot enchant any more people. You
        can still use that power yourself, but not other powers from the Nature unless
        your score is still high enough to access them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, if you have Self 4, you can grant temporary immortality
        equivalent to Self 3 to up to 100 people. This would reduce your Self-Nature 4
        to 2. You would still be able to access immortality, but not other Self 3
        abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purpose of the time ladder, enchantments are considered craft Rituals,
        with a base time of 12 hours, a minimum Nature that matches the effect you're
        granting, and requiring an appropriate Profession at 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enchantments hold until you revoke them or their users release them. The
        enchanted one may hold onto the power for a short time (longer with higher
        Self) to reach a place of safety, and you regain your lost Natures when they
        relinquish the power or it fades from them.
      </p>

      <aside title="Giving the Gift">
        <h4 id="giving_the_gift">Giving the Gift</h4>
        <p>
          The ultimate enchantment is granting the Gift to someone or something that
          did not receive it from Aion. This differs from ordinary enchantment in the
          following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The recipient, if they are currently capable of free will, must be
            willing.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a major Ritual (base time 5 years), requiring Scholar (any) 2 and a
            rating of 1 in all six Natures. Use your weakest Nature in your strongest
            Tradition to determine time steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is considered comparatively simple for a major Ritual, reducing the
            time by one step.
          </li>
          <li>It does not reduce your own Natures, either during or afterward.</li>
          <li>It grants intelligence and free will to things without them.</li>
          <li>The effect is permanent and irrevocable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Gift-giving is most typically used to empower artificial or enhanced beings
          like uplifted animals or clockwork automata. One normally follows up by
          initiating this lucky individual into one’s own Tradition, but that’s not
          required or automatic. The same enchantment that gives the Gift can be used
          to reconnect <a href="CharGen.xhtml#disconnection">disconnected</a> individuals.

      <p>
        Before the Gift, powerful magi were known for their wisdom and cunning, for
        flight, for shapeshifting, for telepathy, for the ability to travel across the
        world in a single day... but also for blowing things up. Magicians use fire,
        lightning, and even bolts of pure darkness to drive off their enemies. Some
        traditions deploy physical assaults rather than energy (Earthpower is known to
        call down meteors), but the effect is essentially the same: the flow is
        converted into destructive force.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Tradition has its own style of energy wave. More than that, each magus
        has their own, distinctively marked with their
        <a href="#magical_signatures">magical signature</a>.
        One Arete practitioner might release a blast of glowing chi, while another
        might send shockwaves through the ground. Some alchemists use explosives while
        others hurl waves of chaos that turn everything to salt. An experienced
        War-mage knows multiple styles of wave, but an investigator who knows
        someone's signature will find it easy to identify their handiwork regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Magi with War 2 can throw energy waves at targets within a spear’s throw. War
        3 allows attacks to be launched from beyond bowshot. More powerful War-mages
        can create waves that scoff at mere matter and strike directly at a target,
        earning them the Connection and Nonphysical descriptors at War 4+. They also
        know the appropriate techniques to defend against that sort of assault, such
        as counter-waves, the conjuration of barriers, or even brief bouts of
        Spirit-Walking.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's possible to tone down an energy wave in order to destroy a small object,
        or just create a crackling field of power around one's hand. Many waves have
        useful side-effects that can be accessed this way, such as creating light
        (fire or lightning), producing a raw material (stone or ice), pushing objects
        around (wind or force bolts), etc. The destructive power of the War-nature can
        sometimes make it difficult to take full advantage of these side effects. For
        instance, it's easy (if loud) to light up a small room with a lightning bolt
        between your hands. Lighting up a giant cavern is going to lead to deafness,
        temporary blindness, and possibly a cave-in. It's also impossible to do any
        good building or excavation with them. Energy waves are definitely not an
        expression of Industry. However, you can demolish just fine, and sometimes
        that's necessary during the construction process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Energy waves tap the flow in moderate amounts. The flow’s aspect might tinge
        the wave with certain side-effects or reduce its effectiveness, but unless the
        aspect clashes badly with the caster's natural aspects, the wave will still be
        emitted and function normally. Battlefields that see substantial use of energy
        waves often pick up a bit of chaotic flow, making them even more dangerous.
      </p>

      <aside title="Attacking Settlements?">
        <h4 id="atk_settlement">Attacking Settlements?</h4>
        <p>
          Large and well-organized settlements are often protected from such assaults
          by a technique known as The Threefold Gates of Retribution. A set of
          emplacements, often menhir or large symbols, are used to absorb or reflect
          War-driven energy. Attackers are well-advised to destroy the emplacements
          first, as they must be stationed outside the area they protect. Otherwise
          the amount of energy required to destroy a city may be reflected against the
          assailants – from the inside.

        Long-range communication is common in many Traditions. Elementalists might

        transcievers.

      <p>
        Farspeech connections are normally created between a handful of people who are
        close together. Communion 4 and a mystic connection can extend that distance
        even across multiple realms of existence. Any number of people can

        you like a local, or at worst, like a well-traveled and mannerly outsider.

      </ul>

      <p>
        One of Trickery’s hallmarks is making people see things that aren’t there.
        Trickery doesn’t create illusions that everyone can see; rather, it projects
        scenarios into the minds of its victims. Those experiencing them will react as
        if they were real, stopping at a wall that is only in their mind, becoming
        physically queasy at an imagined smell, flinging themselves to the ground
        after being trampled by a bull that does not exist. No physical harm is
        done, discomfort and pain are certainly possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those deep in the Trickery-nature can create more encompassing, more
        believable scenarios for their victims:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>No use of this art.</li>
        <li>
          Small or subtle effects. A rock held in the hand. A creeping shadow. The
          aroma of poison added to a drink.
        </li>
        <li>
          A larger or richer effect. A corridor seems to end. A beautiful, aromatic
          flower. A house in enough detail to be believable, at least from the
          outside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shapes that take up most of the view, like a thunderstorm. Crashing sounds,
          overwhelming odors, senses of dread, and other ambient or encompassing
          effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Complete landscapes of beauty or madness. The full experience of an opera
          house on performance night.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Hallucination’s effectiveness is highly dependent on believability. In a
        magical world this is often easier to achieve – someone hurling a tsunami at
        you is not out of the range of possibility – but details are important.
        Tsunamis don’t blink into existence, they rise out of the sea. If someone’s
        storing an object in the Red Space, there should be a rush of flow
        accompanying it. In game terms, all of this is abstracted into the use of an
        appropriate Profession on the part of the attacker. In conflicts,
        Hallucination is most often used with Artist, Scholar, Theurge, or a
        Profession matching the thing that is created (such as Farmer for an animal).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to know what someone else is experiencing, you need to enter
        Rapport with them. The sense-sharing granted by Rapport also trivially breaks
        the effects of Hallucination... so long as the person you’re joining with
        isn’t also affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the flip side, because Hallucination acts on individual minds rather than
        against a massed resistance, it is much easier to affect large numbers of
        people. Reduce the teamwork bonus of the resisting group by one point.

    <section title="Healing" class="spell">

      <h3 id="Healing">Healing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Communion</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Common</li>
        <li><strong>Descriptors:</strong> Connection, Reliable, Ritual</li>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Moderate but varies, see below</li>
        <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Warped flow, Emotional burn-in</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Communion can be used to heal physical and mental injuries. It is used as a
        Craft Ritual requiring Communion 2 and the Healer profession at 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default for healing is resolving a Moderate Complication (like sprains,
        inebriation, minor concussions, panic attacks, disorientation, or the flu)
        with a baseline time of 12 hours. The time is spent in actions appropriate to
        the healer’s Tradition, such as applying healing mud, aligning chakras,
        drawing negative energy away with crystals, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each level of difference in Complication, apply ±2 time steps and adjust
        the amount of flow by one level. Other Ritual modifiers, like access to the
        Universal Repositories or spending Reserve, apply as per usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Healing normally requires moderate amounts of flow. If less flow is available,
        increase the time required by one step per level of difference.
      </p>
      <p>Some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A healer with Comm 3 / Healer 4, healing a Major Complication (like a broken
          bone or minor psychological trauma) could do it in 3 hours by tapping a
          large flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          A healer with Comm 5 / Healer 3 and Repository access could heal a Minor
          Complication (like a cut or nausea) in 30 seconds. This would take just a
          small amount of flow.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Characters whose earthly forms are aspected or constructed may require
        additional Natures to heal them, typically Industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critical Complications can be dealt with this way as well, as if they required
        Communion 6. Even bringing someone back from the dead is possible (but see the
        Resurrection sidebar for additional complications).
      </p>
      <p>There are a few restrictions on Healing:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Only Complications that represent injury or illness can be cured. Being
          tricked or kidnapped is not an injury, though mental or emotional injuries
          count.
        </li>
        <li>
          Self-inflicted Complications are resistant to Healing, as they are
          reinforced by fate or magic.
        </li>
        <li>
          War has techniques that prevent wounds from closing and minds from
          clearing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Healing oneself is done with the Self-nature rather than Communion, and
          does not require one to know this art. See Immortality below for more
          information on self-healing.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Flow tapped for healing must be aspected with a benevolent character, which is
        typically not difficult for a healer to obtain – they can draw it from within
        themselves. However, it's pretty difficult to heal someone you dislike without
        an outside source of benevolent flow. Times are slowed as if the Complication
        were one level worse. Similarly, healing someone who is themselves aspected in
        some way will require some flow of the appropriate kind.
      </p>

      <aside title="Resurrection">
        <h4 id="resurrection">Resurrection</h4>
        <p>
          In game terms, resurrection is simply healing a Critical Complication. Some
          potential issues that might slow you down:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the soul has moved on to its next life, it may not particularly want to
            return. Healing requires the approval of the healed in all parts.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the soul has not reincarnated but is merely absent from the area around
            the body, you need to find it and reattach it, using the
            <a href="#uncountable_spinners">Uncountable Spinners</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the body is missing, you can regrow one from a sample, or from the
            soul, or you can build a new one as an automaton or other magical
            construct. Industry 3.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </aside>

      <aside title="Healing and Becoming">
        <h4 id="heal_become">Healing and Becoming</h4>
        <p>
          Healing is volitional on the part of the healed. In the same way that the
          Self-nature makes you into what you actively want to be, Healing makes a
          person's body and mind into what that person wants. If someone is blind and
          is happy and ok with that, Healing will not regrow their eyes, any more than
          it would remove the extra arms so common among Ægis citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people with dreams of a different life but with low Self-nature will be
          happily surprised when a high-powered healer remakes their body in ways they
          only dreamed of. (The healer is often surprised as well.) Healing doesn't
          “fix injuries”, it makes people closer to their ideal selves.

        Hypnopraxis is the ability to take mental actions while physically asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practitioners of Hypnopraxis can enter Dream Realms (assuming they have Dream
        Travel), solve problems, compose poems or songs, or reach out through Rapport.
        They can conduct purely mental rituals, or those that have an effect only on
        themselves in mind or body. They can even conjure objects that appear next to
        them when they wake. More simply, they can choose what they dream about. None
        of this interferes with getting a good night’s sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, one is somewhat limited by the fact that the body is asleep. A
        certain amount of sleepwalking is possible, but no one’s going to be

      <p>
        Most people in the Kaleidoscope are immortal. They do not die of old age – or
        indeed, of almost any cause whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Characters with Self 2 simply do not age, and heal faster than usual. Those
        with Self 3+ can be harmed, but they will heal. Even when decapitated, they
        need but rejoin their heads to their bodies (or more likely ask a friend to
        help) and they will eventually be none the worse for wear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immortal characters may still take their own lives, if they do it knowingly
        and willingly. In addition, each Fount has a particular weakness by which its
        practitioners can meet their final doom:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Alchemy:</strong> Each alchemist's Potion of Immortality has a
          specific flaw. If another alchemist were to determine the formula through
          espionage or by analyzing blood samples, they could brew a counter-agent,
          which could be delivered by poison or coated weapon. No alchemist could fail
          to recognize the presence of their own counter-agent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arete:</strong> Arete practitioners must be killed by themselves in
          some way – whether by a clone, or by a mirror duplicate, or by being
          strangled with a rope made from their own shed hair.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Earthpower:</strong> Each bearer is weak against a particular plant
          from their homeland. Garlic, mistletoe, and poisonous berries are all common
          choices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Elementalism:</strong> Elementalists can only be killed by being
          dragged to the edge of the Great Basin and thrown, bound and gagged, into
          the formless void beyond the world where existence loses all meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Glory:</strong> The ritual removal of a particular organ is the only
          guarantee of death. Common examples are the heart, the liver, or good
          old-fashioned decapitation. Vaporization doesn't count – the ritual is just
          as important as the removal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Necromancy:</strong> Necromancers are killed when their mouths are
          stuffed with holy materials, such as communion wafers, prayer beads, or
          blessed cloves. The materials must be appropriate to the necromancer's own
          Tradition. Practitioners of Necromancy often achieve “immortality” by
          becoming ghosts; this technique will bring them to nonexistence whether they
          are physical or incorporeal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Oneiromancy:</strong> Each oneiromancer has a particular Dream Realm
          that speaks to their soul. A weapon forged in that world and brought to the
          Great Basin can kill them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Those who follow multiple Traditions have Immortality from just one of them.
        They could change which one, but it would require a minor ritual, and there
        would be a few moments at the climax of that ritual during which they were
        mortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immortality, once obtained, requires only a trickle from the body's internal
        flow to maintain. Magi who are assaulted in severe Null Zones may find that
        they take much longer to heal, but they still will not die from the most
        grievous injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        When immortal people are physically damaged, they heal quickly. Use the rules
        for <a href="#Healing">Healing</a>, but use Self instead of Communion to determine the
        timescale. The Healer profession still applies. Continuing damage (like being
        trapped under a mountain or dissolved in acid) will slow this or prevent it
        entirely.

          As long as you are alive, you can do magic. However, depending on your Path,
          you may not be able to do very much. A severed head could still do
          linguistic magic, and perhaps a touch of blood magic, but it's not going to
          mix reagents very effectively. Being down to just your head also
          substantially reduces the amount of flow you can garner. If you're

        <p>
          The short answer is “not at all”. If your character would be genuinely

          cutscene. If it’s not so bad, the cutscene is not obligatory.
        </p>

          However, it’s worth noting that recovering from some kinds of attacks that
          won’t technically kill you could still take you out of the action for years.

        Unaided, a magus can access small amounts of flow, or build to a moderate
        amount by concentrating. The Industry-nature, interested as it is in numbers
        and size, would like to have more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knotting the flow into storage devices is a ritual. The more involved the
        ritual, the more flow that can be looped and whorled within.

      <p>
        The objects used for knotwork are typically fragile, bulky, or difficult to
        obtain. So long as the container is whole, the flow within is accessible. Once
        used, it can be replenished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different Traditions knot the flow within different things: crystals, urns,
        patterns, snippets of songs, ropes (of course), blood, even connections with
        other people. Those from one tradition will have difficulty accessing flow
        stored by another tradition unless the type of knot fits their Path.
        Lower-quality or older knotwork methods might change the aspect of the flow
        stored within, but modern storage techniques are designed to minimize this
        effect.

      <p>
        A “lagged” curse is one that doesn’t take effect right away. These might wait

      <p>
        Time-delayed curses work best against someone who doesn't enter Rapport often.
        The curse needs to hide itself from everyone who shares the target's mind, and
        someone more perceptive (with a high Mystery-nature) might notice it. The same
        goes for curses set to activate via a specific trigger.

        Characters who regularly access to this Expression become excellent at
        calculation, have near-perfect memories, solve puzzles quickly, and can piece

        through Trickery are more likely to create problems than to solve them.

        Most people are so steeped in the techniques of this art that they use them
        constantly and surreptitiously. Those who are concentrating on difficult tasks
        might use the tools of their Tradition, often in more noticeable manners.
        Mind-sharpening vapors, trances, crystal-gazing, and abacus use are all
        common.

      <p>
        With a bit of careful work (and a craft Ritual) it is possible to extract
        someone’s memories in physical form: a gemstone, a book, a diorama, a knife,
        etc. This object is as breakable as it would normally be, but otherwise immune
        to the ravages of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The target loses the memories. Anyone who interacts with the object will be

      </p>
      <p>
        Each Fount has its own means of operation. Earthpower grows strange plants to
        build structures or drop potion-fruits. Oneiromancy creates things in dreams
        and pulls them into reality. Elementalism sculpts raw matter. Necromancy,
        Glory, and Alchemy call up temporary servants, though of very different sorts.
        Arete adepts simply work harder, faster, and longer into the night. While
        Multitasking most often benefits Industry rituals, there’s no reason it
        couldn’t be used for other purposes as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Characters can work on one extra ritual at a time for each source of
        Multitasking they have, as long as the sources don’t overlap. Since most

      <h3 id="Mystic_Servitors">Mystic Servitors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> All</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Common</li>
        <li><strong>Descriptors:</strong> Ex Nihilo, Ritual</li>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Moderate to create, maintenance varies</li>
        <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Warped flow, Emotional fatigue</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Mystic servitors are automata empowered by a caster's might. Alchemists
        construct clockwork servants; necromancers march their skeletons and war
        ghosts; adepts of earthpower send crows to scout for them; oneiromancers are
        accompanied by beautiful gossamer hand-servants.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating a servitor, select one Nature and one Profession. The servitor
        has those scores, as well as their Core Values, at the ritual-leader’s value
        minus one. All other values are 0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each servitor is created to execute one particular profession's tasks, and can
        follow fairly complex orders within that purview. They don't do much outside
        their creators' direct orders, and can't handle tasks outside their assigned
        profession at all. One with the Soldier profession might be able to “attack”,
        “surround”, “flank”, and “wait for my signal”. One built to spy could “scout
        ahead”, “report”, “sneak in”, and perhaps even “poison their leader”.
        Servitors can act in a Conflict or can be used for a
        <a href="Rules.xhtml#teamwork_conflict">teamwork bonus</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, they're not inventive. A house-servant would be able to “cook me
        dinner” just fine, but they may cook the same thing every time. Geometers and
        alchemists often create mystic servitors with the Scholar profession to check
        their calculations and perform other tedious tasks, but not to help with
        invention.
      </p>
      <p>In game terms, mystic servitors are created via rituals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Craft rituals make a single servitor.</li>
        <li>Minor rituals make a few dozen servitors.</li>
        <li>
          Major rituals create enough servitors to fill out a brigade or a mid-sized
          town.
        </li>
        <li>Great Works create groups sized for Infrastructure I.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Servitors normally run on ambient flow. They can be created from any sort of
        flow, though it must be appropriate to their work. If any servitor enters a
        Null Zone that reduces their Nature to 0, they are deactivated.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also possible to create temporary servitors, powered by the caster's own
        flow. Each ritual's worth of temporary servitors runs down, decays, falls
        apart, or is otherwise rendered useless when the ritual-leader creates a new
        “batch” of them. However, they are 4 time steps faster to create.
      </p>
      <p>
        Servitors aspect the flow near them with various flavors depending on how they
        are used. Nations that keep a large standing army of defenders often force
        their “downstream” neighbors to deal with both depletion and pollution of
        flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Servitors are not typically given senses beyond the usual five, and often lack
        one or more of those. By paying an extra time-step in the ritual one can add
        the <a href="#Sixth_Sense">Sixth Sense</a>.

            <strong>Industry</strong> servitors build things, carry things, dig foundations, cook

          <li>
            <strong>Mystery</strong> servitors are spies, or sometimes calculators. They're often

      <p>Many adepts of Earthpower enchant animals or plants for special purposes.</p>

        When employing this art, use the rules for Mystic Servitors (see above), or
        perhaps <a href="#conjuration">Conjuration</a> or
        <a href="#Telekinesis">Telekinesis</a>. There’s no
        difference in game terms between calling an animal and conjuring it, or
        between an animated set of vines and the use of TK. Nature-work is a very
        flexible art, if somewhat more susceptible to disruption when someone burns
        down the local vegetation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, this art is simply flavor added to a Ritual. However, it’s
        worth noting the difference because nature-work doesn’t expire in the same
        way. Once you enchant a tree to grow ripe apples every day, it doesn’t just
        stop when you walk away. Goats enchanted to give ink rather than milk will
        pass that on to their kids, who might drink the surprisingly nutritious ink,
        or might die instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Basin is filled from hub to rim with strange forms of life that have
        undoubtedly been forged with this art at some point in the past. Healing herbs
        that grow like weeds. Moss that absorbs speech and releases it when stepped
        upon. Birds whose feather patterns indicate their migration paths and who have
        tiny strips on their legs to tie messages. Behemoths that grow fortresses on
        their backs. Earthpower adepts are taught to be very cautious with their use
        of this art, and to clean up after themselves.

        Nightmare Exile is the art of pushing an unwilling victim into a Dream Realm

      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the name, there is no need to push one’s target into an unpleasant
        world. Sometimes you just need them out of the way, and people who are in a
        realm of joy and relaxation are less likely to want to escape.

        clears, and the future can be told more easily, but as one departs from the

      <p>
        Psychometry allows you to see glimpses of the past. You examine a person,
        object, or location and receive psychic impressions from it. You'll see who
        used the object, who conspired in the location, who this person met. A knife
        will tell you who it killed. A bed will tell you what was whispered there.
      </p>

          Unintentional psychometry. You might receive brief unasked-for flashes of
          insight from physical contact with a person or thing. These typically reach
          no more than a day into the past.

        <li>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The brief rituals of psychometry may involve burning hallucinatory incense,
        drawing a circle in which to meditate, or painting with the eyes closed. The
        subject need not be touched, but it should be close by.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of psychometry and the <a href="#Sixth_Sense">Sixth Sense</a>, investigations that
        discover a tool (a murder knife, a brush used to remove fingerprints, a book
        full of correspondence in invisible ink) can identify its true purpose much
        more easily. Flow that exudes from objects is aspected by the ways in which
        those things were used. Naturally, Trickery and Mystery techniques can obscure
        such things, given time to prepare.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common way to get around psychometry is by destroying all evidence.
        Murderers and thieves are thus often arsonists as well, sending whole
        buildings up in smoke in an attempt to get away with their crimes. People's
        bodies also cease to hold psychometric resonance if they are destroyed or
        badly burned. The crime rate in most of the Basin is rather low because of
        psychometry, but those crimes that are committed are often more severe.
      </p>
      <p>Psychometric visions allow one to use all senses, including Sixth Sense.</p>

      <aside title="Centrality Matters">

        <p>
          The more important something is to a particular event, the better
          Psychometry can tell what happened. A card from a deck carried in someone's
          pocket as they committed a murder will carry a much weaker impression of the
          event than the bloody knife. A stone taken from a ritual circle will know
          better what the ritual was than a stone that was merely nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
          If not centrality, then size. All else being equal, locations are better
          keys to the past than objects, and an intact building will know what
          happened inside better than a single floorboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          If not size? Each Fount has its own specialties as to where it can best
          obtain information. An Arete master might look at books and tools; an
          Elementalist at gemstones and ashes; an Oneiromancer at the feel of a scene
          rather than the information given by each part.

      <p>
        Rapport is the act of sharing minds and souls with another being. It allows
        perfect communication without the need for language. Achieving Rapport
        typically takes about a minute and can be done up to a few paces away.
        Communion 4 and a mystic connection can extend that distance even across
        multiple realms of existence. Any number of people can theoretically share
        Rapport at once, with each of them adding more individuals with whom they
        share a mystic connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional bonds can be formed or broken very quickly during Rapport.
        Characters who have experienced Rapport a few times will know how to share
        what they want and hold back their private selves. The inexperienced will tend
        to over-share.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rapport requires small amounts of flow when the other person is nearby. If it
        is being used at great distances or across worlds, it requires a moderate
        amount of flow. It always draws from all participants, though not necessarily
        to the same extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rapport is often used as part of intimate emotional situations, including
        weddings, sex, and ceremonies.
      </p>

          With permission, one character in Rapport can take control of another's
          body. If both have a particular Profession, they can use the
          <a href="Rules.xhtml#teamwork_conflict">Teamwork rules</a>.
          If only one has a Profession, the others can use it at the
          same time without the Teamwork bonus.
        </p>
        <p>
          As souls are shared, so can magic be shared, and one character can express
          their Tradition through the body of another. The more different their
          Traditions, the harder this will be. For example, practitioners of the
          Sacred Geometry rarely carry the meteorite fragments needed for The Starlit
          Way. A mismatch in Founts results in a -1 to all Nature scores, as does a
          mismatch in Paths. Only one character can wield their magic at a time this
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters in Rapport can also pool their flow to accomplish greater deeds.
          Quickly sending or absorbing more power than a typical body can hold (more
          than a moderate amount of flow) disrupts the connection, and Rapport must be
          reestablished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long-term Rapport between people who want a deep and indelible connection
          with one another can result in group-minds, where decisions are made not by
          individuals but by an amalgam of all of them. Treat these as a single
          character with multiple bodies, using the Swarm
          <a href="CharGen.xhtml#earthlyform">Earthly Form</a>.
          Group-minds take about a year of continuous Rapport to form between typical
          like-minded individuals.

    <section title="The Red Space" class="spell">

      <h3 id="The_Red_Space">The Red Space</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Trickery 2 or 4</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Grand Wonderwork</li>
        <li><strong>Descriptors:</strong> Access, Loud, Uncast</li>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Large or higher</li>
        <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Flow depletion</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At every point in the Kaleidoscope there is a strange world tangent to our
        own. It is lit from all directions with an uneasy red light. It is accessible
        to anyone who knows the proper thought sequence. Time flows normally but its
        effects are lost – no one grows old, or tired, or hungry. Most importantly, it
        is a universe far more vast than our own, where every thumbs-width in our
        world is a koss in theirs. If you and a friend step through while holding each
        others' hands, you will not be able to see each other when you arrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Red Space is used primarily for storage – vast amounts of storage, though
        only a small amount at a time. Transferring a typical goblet would require,
        for a moment, all the flow an ordinary person can bring to bear. Bringing in
        something more than human-sized can only be done on a ley line, and something
        more than wagon-sized is prohibitively flow-expensive. Instead, people place
        things they value here and lock the access point with their own magical
        signature. One must be able to both replicate the signature and find the
        precise access point in order to retrieve what has been left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opening a portal to the Red Space is like uncorking a drain in the flow. If
        left open, such a portal will deplete all flow from the surrounding foot or
        two in about a minute, and then snap shut. Careful analysis of the flow
        indicates that this power seeps into some sort of pattern within the space,
        suggesting that the Red Space was artificially created.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Trickery 4 one can duplicate this feat on a smaller scale, conjoining a
        small portion of Red Space to oneself, to store and retrieve objects at need.
        Each item is “attached” to a particular point on the body. This space remains
        with the character even if they leave the Kaleidoscope, though they may not be
        able to access it in Null Zones. Opening the portal is Loud, but carrying an
        item there is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the <a href="#The_Shell_Game">Shell Game</a>, the Red Space is an expression of
        Trickery, and can be turned to a number of unexpected uses that have nothing
        to do with tricking anyone. For instance, refrigeration is fairly uncommon
        across the Basin. Instead, many people store food in the Red Space because it
        doesn't decay there. The flow needs are high for a common household procedure,
        but it's only temporary. The Nova Commonwealth’s ley line overflow sluices
        prevent dangerous flow spillover by repeatedly opening holes to the Red Space,
        simply removing the flow from existence.
      </p>

      <aside title="Getting Spaced">
        <h4 id="getting_spaced">Getting Spaced</h4>
        <p>
          Staying within the Red Space for an extended time is not encouraged. Some
          have built fortresses here, but those people are cautionary tales.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the realm itself swallowing flow quickly, within minutes it becomes
          impossible to leave on one's own. Even with one's eyes closed, the sickly
          light is still visible. Those who are without sight report a dual-toned
          humming that they cannot ignore, or a scent that gnaws at the edges of
          consciousness. One cannot sleep – cannot stop thinking – cannot escape. The
          mind slowly breaks under such conditions. Leaving someone in the Red Space
          should be considered a Critical Complication.

      <aside title="Regeneration?">
        <h3 id="no_regen">Regeneration?</h3>
        <p>
          The regeneration granted by Self is identical to healing done with
          Communion. Use the same rules and timescales. The exception is that
          regeneration is purely physical: you cannot heal your own mind. Mental and
          emotional strain require outside assistance to heal.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <aside title="Repair?">
        <h3 id="no_repair">Repair?</h3>
        <p>
          Repair is not its own separate art. It is a combination of trained skill,
          Distillation, Conjuration, and sometimes even Psychometry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repair typically takes one step less flow than Conjuration for the same size
          of object. It requires either the appropriate skill to create the object in
          the first place, or a Canon of Form very closely matched to the one that
          originally produced it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repair-work does not rewind time. It recreates the original to the best of
          the caster’s ability. If you try to restore the missing pages from a book,
          it will be as if you wrote them yourself.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <aside title="Scrying?">
        <h3 id="no_scrying">Scrying?</h3>
        <p>
          Many fantasy settings allow some sort of scrying – remote viewing,
          clairvoyance, crystal balls, and so forth. Sorcerously Advanced doesn’t have
          that. The Mystery-nature gathers information in person, via Psychometry and
          the Sixth Sense, or nearly-in-person by using the arts of the Shroud or
          Spirit-walking to spy on someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way Sorcerously Advanced’s setting is put together, scrying is either
          impossible or no one has figured out how to do it yet. In-game, this is
          because the space that was once used for scrying was literally turned
          inside-out to become the Red Space, rupturing in the process and spilling
          its flow into the void beyond worlds. Out-of-game, there are a few reasons
          that scrying in particular was dropped from the game during design:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Game balance. It’s difficult to write a flexible, powerful system for
            scrying that isn’t also ripe for abuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cutting down on frustration. It's hard for GMs to write plots with
            long-range scrying in mind, unless scrying countermeasures are universally
            available. If there are easily available countermeasures, players would
            start to wonder why they even have the ability to scry in the first place
            if it’s always going to be blocked when they need it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Narrowing the themes of the game. If there were methods for essentially
            unrestricted scrying, there would need to be at least one civilization
            based entirely around that sort of total surveillance. We decided to focus
            on other topics.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you as the GM want to bring scrying into your game, or allow your players
          to invent it, be aware that it will change the world substantially.
          “Everyone has invisible drones with cameras” doesn’t even begin to cover it.
          It could be a heck of a storyline, or it could ruin your game. You may want
          to have a conversation with your players before you introduce a change of
          this magnitude.

    <section title="Shapeshifting" class="spell">

      <h3 id="shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Self 2+</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Restricted</li>
        <li><strong>Descriptors:</strong> none</li>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Small, must come from user only</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Common side effects:</strong> Chakra occlusion, Emotional burn-in
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Shapeshifting comes in three tiers. The first, at Self 2, changes your
        physical abilities through minor alterations to your body. You might enhance
        your eyes with the sight of an eagle, reinforce your skin with metal or
        crystal, give your tendons the flexibility of water, or become as light as
        your dreams. All of these changes are visible to onlookers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second tier, at Self 3, provides devotees of the Self a few specific other
        forms that they can attain. Each of them is tied to the character's Tradition,
        and their Fount in particular. Someone with Earthpower might keep the shell
        from a bird's egg or the skin of a deer so as to become those creatures. An
        Elementalist might light a massive bonfire and step into it in order to
        transform into a fire elemental (with the help of the
        <a href="#Transcendence">Transcendence</a> art.
        An Arete master might take on some helpful instincts of a form – the
        climbing skill of a goat, the reflexes of a snake – without leaving their
        human shape. No matter what their Tradition, characters with Self 2-3 should
        choose no more than a half-dozen alternate forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later on, mastery of the Self-nature (4+) allows you to take on a myriad of
        forms appropriate to your Fount, including those with more unusual
        characteristics. You can also remain who you are even when your form changes
        against your will. If someone else attempts to alter your form, you can treat
        it as if the magic were your own and retain complete control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several appropriate forms are listed below for each Fount. These should be
        considered examples rather than a complete list.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Alchemy:</strong> Iron automata, silver angels, bronze tigers,
          quicksilver nightingales, crystalline orreries, dogs of salt, sulfur-koi,
          spheres of radiance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Arete:</strong> Arete practitioners always take on animal
          characteristics rather than changing forms: the stealth of the fox, the
          strength of the elephant, the climbing grip of the orangutan, the leap of
          the gazelle, the lightness of the robin, the speed of the salmon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Earthpower:</strong> All manner of natural plants and animals form
          the core of Earthpower's shapeshifting Expressions. Advanced bearers of the
          power can also become more imaginative representations of nature, like
          walking trees, creeping fungus-beasts, swift whirlwinds, or even living
          earthquakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Elementalism:</strong> Vaguely humanoid shapes of the five elements.
          The more powerful the Self-nature, the more intense the manifestation. See
          also the <a href="#Transcendence">Transcendence</a> art.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Glory:</strong> Angels, demons, shadows, spiders, birds, toads,
          weasels, ravens, storks, ibis, dragons, phoenix, and other forms with strong
          symbolic meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Necromancy:</strong> Shadows, skeletons, zombies, vultures, crows,
          worms, poisonous vermin, and other creatures associated with death. See also
          below for becoming a ghost.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Oneiromancy:</strong> A dream-lord might become nearly anything,
          from an ant to a house. What is certain is that it will be many-colored and
          strange, that it will flow and move in unusual ways, and that it will seem
          just a bit different to everyone who sees it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Shapeshifting cannot change one’s Earthly Form (except for the single/swarm
        pairing). Shapechanging that makes one into a lightning elemental, ghost,
        spirit, or other being of energy or desire is handled by the arts of
        <a href="#Transcendence">Transcendence</a>.
        It’s not uncommon to combine the two when becoming, for example, a void-crow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking on some mental characteristics of the form you attain is fairly common,
        as aspected flow is continuously present through your body. If you change into
        a form that alters your Nature scores, you should immediately recalculate your
        Power and Import.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shapeshifting will only accept flow from within the user. Regardless of the
        form, shifting locks up the majority of one's magical power, reducing all
        other Natures by 1 (to a minimum of 1). If someone turns you into a frog, and
        you choose to remain as a frog rather than becoming what you were before, your
        magical power is likewise locked away. The Self-nature is unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're trying to force a shift on someone else, that should be treated as a
        <a href="#curses">Curse</a>, using War rather than Self. When shifting others in a
        helpful manner, use an <a href="#Enchantment">Enchantment</a> ritual.
      </p>

    <section title="The Shell Game" class="spell">

      <h3 id="The_Shell_Game">The Shell Game</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Trickery 3</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Descriptors:</strong> Silent, Uncast</li>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Minimal</li>
        <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Emotional fatigue, Chaotic flow</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When sorcerers reach for magical power, they pull some of it from the
        wellspring that is within all living beings, but they generally also tap the
        flow of the world around them. The same is true of their tools. A geometer's
        healing tattoos rely on outside flow as much as possible, pulling from their
        bearer's reserves only when necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because many techniques and devices require very specific types of flow, it's
        possible to disrupt their operation if you feed them the wrong type. The
        “shell game” quickly and quietly replaces flow of one aspect in the local
        environment with flow of an entirely different aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the person running the shell game is unprepared, they can still slow down
        others and cause malfunctions in their Expressions, or even wild magic surges.
        That makes the shell game perfect for a subtle conflict. If the game runner is
        prepared, they can feed in flow of a conflicting type, potentially causing
        sixth sense mirages, backfiring curses, unstable conjured objects (or the
        wrong object entirely), energy wave explosions, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arts that are noted as using little or no flow can be adapted on the fly to
        use only the mage's internal store, but that won't prevent the first
        incidence, only later disasters. The shell game itself requires very little
        flow (befitting its Silent descriptor), but that flow must be aspected with
        treachery or deception and cannot come from within the person running the game
        – it must be drawn from outside.
      </p>

      <aside title="Tricking Trickery">
        <h4 id="tricky_trick">Tricking Trickery</h4>
        <p>
          Unlike other Natures, Trickery can be subverted. Many applications for its
          Expressions have nothing at all to do with its original purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, the Shell Game forms the basis of numerous flow redirection
          mechanisms. If there's a ley line that flows the wrong direction, a flow
          “irrigation” process that delivers power to otherwise low-magic areas, or a
          system that hinders violent action by deflecting War-aspected flow into the
          ground, you can bet that the mechanics of the shell game are hidden
          somewhere inside. These applications fall under Industry instead of
          Trickery.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the shell game is normally used to ruin someone's day, it's also
          possible to provide someone with exactly the aspect they need at just the
          right moment. This uses the usual teamwork rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wild mages use the Shell Game extensively to mix aspects together. To beckon
          seeds to grow, an elementalist might combine earth's stability, water's
          nourishing, and air's swiftness. To generate skeletal servants, a
          necromancer might take the motion from a flickering shadow, the obedience of
          a beloved pet, and the old stubbornness of the ground to bind it all
          together.

      <p>
        Mystery not only seeks out and understands, it also conceals. When people
        create a mystery rather than solving one, they do so using the arts of the
        shroud.
      </p>
      <p>
        At lower levels, the Shroud allows one to move without being seen or heard,
        and without leaving traces behind. Higher levels allow one to vanish from
        plain sight, hide objects in clear view, and even cause memories of one’s
        presence to fade quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Shroud’s particular chakra occlusion is fairly mild: it prevents one from
        using any Loud arts. Someone skulking about must drop their concealment in
        order to Travel or launch an energy wave, for example.

      <p>
        Magi of all stripes have a “sixth sense” that allows them to perceive the
        flow, determine its quantity and aspect, and guess what its whorls indicate
        about the shapes it took recently (and thus what was done with it).
      </p>
      <p>
        Your sixth sense isn’t something you need to intentionally activate. Most
        adults are continuously and subconsciously “reading” or “tasting” the flow
        around them whenever they're awake and alert. People who are distracted,
        tired, or intoxicated are likely to miss things. Fine details are easier to
        spot if you intentionally pay attention.

      <p>Here are the effects at various Mystery ranks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>No ability to perceive flow.</li>
        <li>

          Read the aspects imparted on flow by nations and cities upstream from a ley

      <p>
        Sixth sense does not require any use of flow to operate at short range.
        Reading things at a distance requires more flow and a connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        More careful examinations of flow can be enhanced with tools, in much the same
        way that a spyglass extends one’s sight. As with all arts, the user's favored
        Path points towards the sort of tool that might be used. Those walking the
        path of Reagents peer through crystals; those of Discipline might make small
        mudras and feel flows in their hearts; those with Patrons may hear whispers.
        The Geometer's Guild refers to Aspect Diapason Assay, which they do via
        measurement, sometimes with tools, sometimes by thumb and eye.
        <a href="flow_detector">Automated flow detectors</a> are also possible.

      <p>This is the primary art of the Mystery-nature.</p>

        Soul-work encompasses a wide range of techniques dealing with the soul. With
        this expression of the Self, one can...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Divide a soul into parts</li>
        <li>Bind loose souls into objects or ready bodies.</li>

        </li>
        <li>
          With Trickery, steal a tiny fragment of someone’s soul without them
          noticing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Most uses of Soul-work are Craft Rituals. See below for more about souls
        and their uses.
      </p>

      <aside title="The Soul">
        <h4 id="the_soul">The Soul</h4>
        <p>Your shadow is your soul.</p>
        <p>
          Just because it's noon doesn't mean your soul goes away. Even if you're in a
          room that is magically lit from all sides so there's no shadow, there's
          still shadow inside you. You can close your eyes and summon your power and
          it will call up the protections written on your soul so that you can see
          them, inspect them, and activate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to inscribe magical wards and protections on your soul, you can
          do it. You need a steady light source or some way to pin your shadow in
          place, and and a steady hand with some fancy inks or reagents. Soul-drawn
          wards are fairly common. Most people whose Traditions involve runes,
          geometry, written spells, etc. will have things inscribed on their soul and
          visible when their shadow is visible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The soul is imperishable, but not indestructible. That is, it can never be
          completely eradicated, but you can split it up, sell it, steal it, trade it,
          damage it, or tear it. Something can gnaw on it, or you can have it
          stretched thin like butter over too much bread. If it's damaged, but you
          haven't given any of it away or had any of it sorcerously stolen and
          preserved, it will eventually regrow, though it may take a year if it's
          almost entirely gnawed away.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone steals your soul, it's still your soul and not theirs. If it's
          destroyed in their possession, it regrows on you, not them. If you sell or
          trade a piece, however, that's theirs now, and it regrows in their
          possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you die, your soul may go to an afterlife in the Worlds Beyond that is
          familiar to people of your culture. However, it may also attach to your
          ghost, or may reincarnate. If you sold part of your soul, it's still
          part-sold when you reincarnate. If someone stole it, it's still stolen in
          your next life.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone has a piece of your soul, they can use it to do magic in the same
          way that you can. This was a bigger deal before the Gift, when demons would
          buy souls from wizards and sell them to those who wanted power. However,
          it's still important now, because it does two things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Supernatural beings who did not receive a full portion of the Gift can
            emulate that power by obtaining someone else's soul.
          </li>
          <li>
            When someone uses your soul to do magic, they do it in your way, with your
            personal magical signature.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As the amount of soul attached to your body decreases (through trade, theft,
          or damage) there are three common effects:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your <a href="CharGen.xhtml#earthlyform">Earthly Form</a> takes on the same aspect as the most
            prevalent local flows. This should be handled via the <a href="Rules.xhtml#worst_enemy">Worst Enemy Rule</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            You heal more slowly when your body has been destroyed.
            (See <a href="#Immortality">Immortality</a>.)
            This should be handled via the <a href="Rules.xhtml#bad_luck">Bad Luck Rule</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Those who are entirely without a soul are only immune to possession and
            mind control so long as they are conscious. If they sleep or faint,
            various spirits might attempt to take control.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In addition, this can cause issues for <a href="#Resurrection">resurrection</a>.
          as it requires at least a fragment of the soul. This effect is not eligible
          for the Worst Enemy or <a href="Rules.xhtml#bad_luck">Bad Luck Rule</a>s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that soul damage is much like any other sort of damage, and should
          be handled through the regular conflict/Complication system. Stealing or
          severing a piece of someone's soul should be a Major Complication, usually
          inflicted via Trickery or War and resisted with Self.

        Many effects skirt the edges of this power: curses, for example, can compel

        another’s mind into a particular action.

    <section title="Spirit-Walking" class="spell">

      <h3 id="Spirit-Walking">Spirit-Walking</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Mystery 3+</li>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> Common</li>
        <li><strong>Descriptors:</strong> Nonphysical, Silent</li>
        <li><strong>Flow:</strong> Minimal</li>
        <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Warped flow, Chakra occlusion</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Spirit-walking allows you to walk through unwarded walls, avoid the sight of
        those with a weak Mystery-Nature, and leave no trace in the physical world.
        Despite the name of this technique, even spirits cannot perceive those who
        move in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interacting with objects (other than via observation) ends the effect. One can
        speak in a whisper and touch with a feather-light hand, but more ruins the
        spell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Fount has its own unique approach. Necromancers and some Invokers step
        into a shadow realm parallel to the Kaleidoscope, and their bodies darken to
        silhouettes. Oneiromancers step in and out of dream realms as rainbows of fog.
        Elementalists turn themselves into spirits of air or void. Practitioners of
        Arete, Earthpower, and sometimes Glory shift their bodies forms of pure
        spirit. Each Fount's method can also be blocked in specific ways, which are
        typically easy to spot and require maintenance. (In terms of descriptors,
        blocks against Spirit-walking are <a href="#descriptors">Loud</a>.)
        The only way to block all varieties of spirit-walking is to create
        multi-layered protection or a Null Zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each approach to this art has its own limitations that can be overcome with
        sufficient expertise. For example, winds might blow a novice Elementalist
        off-course, but not an experienced one. Light might bar a young Necromancer,
        but an experienced one will deftly pour their shadow-body through cracks in
        rock and wood.
      </p>
      <p>
        The art of spirit-walking requires very little flow, but applies a continuous
        aspecting to all flow available to the caster. The aspect is appropriate to
        the caster's Fount and its method of spirit-walking. All Natures are reduced
        by 1 except when using Expressions that fit the appropriate aspect. For
        example, an Alchemist moving through reflections might Travel or access the
        Red Space, but could not easily heal someone or throw an energy wave. An
        Elementalist moving as mist could use their air-based spells, but would have
        difficulty with fire and stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spirit-walking pairs well with Travel and the arts of the Shroud.
        Spirit-walkers can always use Shroud Expressions at their full Nature
        regardless of this spell’s chakra occlusion side effect. Travel gateways
        opened by spirit-walking individuals are treated as Silent.
      </p>

      <aside title="Trapped as Spirits">
        <h4 id="trappe_as_spirits">Trapped as Spirits</h4>
        <p>
          Characters who spirit-walk extensively may eventually become stuck in this
          state. This is similar to having an Earthly Form that is Phased Out and
          Aspected, but with the additional disadvantage of chakra occlusion as
          described above. Becoming “unstuck” should require the same work as
          overcoming a Major Complication.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <aside title="Dematerialized">
        <h4 id="dematerialized">Dematerialized</h4>
        <p>
          Spirit-walking provides a great degree of protection from the physical
          world. In the same way that a spirit-walker can pass through walls, arrows
          and avalanches likewise pose little difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Characters who are normally <a href="CharGen.xhtml#earthlyform">Phased Out</a> do not use
          spirit-walking to touch the physical world. Instead, they use
          <a href="#Telekinesis">Telekinesis</a>
          if they know it, to move objects, and use spirit-walking to
          become invisible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spirit-walking characters still need air, though they might be able to
          compensate for that in other ways.

      <p>
        The <a href="#canon_form">Canon of Form</a> is large but strict. People can conjure only what
        they know, or what is known by those around them. Therefore, some Traditions
        have found it valuable to adjust the Canon for various purposes. Tailoring the
        Canon accomplishes one of the following things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Destroys an object to add it to the local Consensus Canon,</li>
        <li>Removes a thing from the local Consensus Canon, or</li>
        <li>
          Makes minor but perhaps important edits to something in the local Consensus
          Canon.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Those nearby the magus can take advantage of these changes (or fall prey to
        them). The changes propagate outward to a village-sized area at Industry 4, or
        about a koss away at Industry 5. The effects last for about a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, the caster’s Fount should serve as a guide for what changes can be
        made. An Elementalist might conjure trees made of ice or stone, whereas an
        Earthpower adept might instead create buildings out of living wood. Disciples
        of Glory might make a creature more beautiful or terrifying. There are rarely
        game effects from this.

      <p>
        Telekinesis lifts and moves objects at a distance. It is most commonly used in
        construction and for utility purposes. Different Founts manifest it in
        different ways – gusts of wind, helpful cherubs, ghostly machinery – but the
        effects are governed by the caster’s Industry-nature.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>No effect.</li>
        <li>Move up to 50 kg – a child or a small animal.</li>
        <li>Move up to 200 kg – a person.</li>
        <li>Move up to a ton – a wagon.</li>
        <li>Move up to five tons – a stone block.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can also move yourself, assuming you have Industry 3 or higher.</p>
      <p>
        Telekinesis is slow. If you’re attacking someone with bolts of force or
        hurling them about with winds, that’s an Energy Wave, because it expresses the
        War-Nature. You can get up to a high speed after a few minutes (forty koss an
        hour, give or take) but it’s not easy to turn or accelerate.

        The Stones destroy via resonance with the flow of the Basin. They enhance a

        The caster’s Fount and nearby options shape the result. An elementalist might
        turn a campfire into a conflagration. A disciple of Glory might make starlight

      </p>
      <p>
        This art is not completely reliable. Different people react to fear in
        different ways. In general, those with a lower War-nature will cower or flee,

        Treat Transmutation effectively as Conjuration, but without the need to adhere

      <p>
        Referred to by the Geometer’s Guild as Lattice Travel, this is the
        Kaleidoscope's fastest and most reliable method of long-distance
        transportation. Travel allows Industry practitioners to move from one location
        to another without traveling through the Great Basin. Those whose souls ring
        with commerce and enterprise can open portals onto pathways and wide bridges
        that were long ago built into the fabric of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lattice Travel always opens onto a five-koss-long bridge, regardless of the
        distance in the Basin. The path spans a void in which uncountable numbers of
        other bridges can be found. Doors appear and disappear at each end as this
        power is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arriving at your destination more quickly is merely a matter of running or
        flying down the path. It is possible to leap from one bridge to another
        (gravity is nonexistent once one is off the path), but the destination of the
        portal at the end is impossible to determine from within the lattice. One
        might end up in the depths of a sea, or falling from the edge of the world.
        Stories abound of madmen escaping from the authorities via such leaps, but the
        stories are rarely about the 99% whose immortality is sorely tested in the
        attempt.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a rare commodity indeed that cannot be shipped through the Travel
        lattice rather than overland across the Basin. Nearly all long-distance
        shipping is via Travel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Travel is does not demand much flow unless the portal is kept open for more
        than a few seconds. The space within the Travel lattice is a -1 Null Zone. It
        has no flow of its own, but the flow constantly leaks in from myriad worlds
        via the uncountable doors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Travel is kind to its users. If you travel it with little guidance, it will
        nudge you toward open spaces with flat surfaces. Those with more specific
        destinations in mind can go where they wish. If you try to Travel into solid
        rock or the depths of the sea, you probably won't be able to open the
        destination doorway, and you'll need to walk back to where you came from or
        risk the awful leap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Travel can reach distant locations in the Basin and other worlds of the
        Kaleidoscope, as well as the Worlds Beyond and back. It can also take one from
        realm to realm within the Worlds Beyond, but for movement within a particular
        realm Travel fails, and one must walk or fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Travelers who arrive from a particular world in the Kaleidoscope arrive at
        the same place within that realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Travel cannot reach the Dream Worlds (see <a href="#Dream_Travel">Dream Travel</a>)
        or the <a href="#The_Red_Space">Red Space</a>.
      </p>

      <aside title="Detecting Travel" id="detecting_travel">
        <h4>Detecting Travel</h4>
        <p>
          Just as Travel is anything but quiet at its starting point, those at the
          destination will also be warned. Someone with the
          <a href="#Sixth_Sense">Sixth Sense</a> and
          Mystery 3+ can sense that a Travel door will open nearby, and though they
          may not know why, they will have a fairly good idea of when. Mystery 4+
          allows magicians to “peek” into the Lattice to see who is coming, and how
          far away they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between one’s presence being announced and the uncertainty of targeting the
          destination, Travel is rarely used for quiet thefts.

      <aside title="Targeting Travel">
        <h4 id="targeting_travel">Targeting Travel</h4>
        <p>
          In order to reach a particular destination via Travel, you must be able to
          specify the destination unambiguously. You can refer to landmarks,
          directions, distances, or people or objects to whom you have a mystic
          connection. Ambiguous directions result in unreliable travel and might
          invoke the <a href="Rules.xhtml#bad_luck">Bad Luck Rule</a>. Here are a few examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the Cloud City of Spindrift, on the world of Carcer, just inside the
            rimward gate.
          </li>
          <li>
            As close as I can get to my friend Dawn, whose talisman I'm holding.
          </li>
          <li>
            10 koss hubward of Resin City along the River Fang, near the cliffside.
            (Approximate locations are ok if you don't care where along the cliff you
            arrive.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The throne room of Sun-Slayer the Conquerer. (If there are two people of
            that name and title, you may not get the one you want.)
          </li>
          <li>
            The tallest spire in the city described in the book I just read. (If that
            city no longer exists, or was a fiction, you may end up at the place in
            your current world that seems closest.)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Travel also relies on lattice points spaced about 10 meters apart, making
          pinpoint accuracy impossible. Those with access to Travel can sense the
          access point nearest to them using the Sixth Sense. It is a Craft Ritual
          requiring Industry 4+ to move a lattice point, and many important people
          have their meeting rooms and bedrooms cleared of lattice points.

        People who use Rapport slowly gain knowledge of how to speak so that anyone
        can understand them, and how to hear what people mean no matter what language
        they speak. True Speech isn’t a language, and it’s not a translation – it’s a
        sharing of meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, many children no longer learn a formal language. Their parents
        (and other adults in their lives) simply comprehend them immediately. They
        form simple languages with one another when playing or living together. Much
        like writing, formal languages are taught later in life, providing greater
        structure and character to communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        True Speech is only for language-in-the-moment. It will enhance spoken word,
        sign language, even semaphore, but it will not give one the ability to read
        another language. There is no written equivalent to True Speech.

      <p>
        Souls naturally drift toward the Worlds Beyond. Bodies anchor them to the
        Basin. When the body dies, what keeps the soul from moving on immediately?
      </p>
      <p>
        Examine the world closely enough with your sixth sense and you will perceive a
        thousand ghostly silkworms leaving a gauzy, intangible tapestry that catches
        only the spirit. These are the Uncountable Spinners of Silver Cord, and they
        tie one’s soul to the Basin after death, drawing it toward reincarnation.
        Those who practice well can tug on the cords, gathering wisps of silver to
        urge a soul back toward the Kaleidoscope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manipulating the cords requires a mystic connection with the departed in order
        to bring them back to the Basin. When the soul returns, it animates a ghost,
        which can be conversed with – or one can use <a href="#Soul-Work">Soul-work</a>
        on the departed as with any other captured soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Uncountable Spinners are a Core Expression for you, you don’t need the
        mystic connection, but you do need to be able to definitively specify the
        exact person you seek. “Whomever is buried in this grave” will work if there
        is just one person in the grave. “Any soldier who died in this battle” will
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those skilled with the Spinners can also contain and trade unattached souls,
        or pieces of them. At Self 5+, they can send an unattached soul to its next
        life immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web that the Spinners make is broken in many places. If it were whole,
        scholars believe that everyone would reincarnate immediately, and the Worlds
        Beyond would be populated only by their natives.

        <li><strong>Common side effects:</strong> Emotional fatigue</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Universal Repositories are ways to store information so that it can later be
        retrieved from any location. They are accessible from all points in all
        universes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessing a Universal Repository only requires a touch of properly-aspected
        flow and the willingness to enter Rapport with the Repository itself. Someone
        with an appropriate Communion-nature could do it by holding a book or tablet,
        as could someone in a classroom or holding a quill pen. Those accessing a
        Repository can create duplicates of scrolls, books, tablets, etc. from it
        using <a href="#conjuration">Conjuration</a>, or can simply concentrate and read the text
        without calling forth the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Searching a repository can take a long time. Higher Communion and Mystery
        ratings speed your research. The repositories can deliver specific named texts
        or those that fit certain limited queries – they know the topics of texts,
        know the author's magical signature, know which version of a text is most
        recent, and know when materials were committed to them. They do not know fact
        from fiction. You get what you ask for immediately, but if you can't specify
        exactly what you want, you might end up asking for a lot of different things
        before you get the right text. This is especially true for non-experts looking
        for specialized knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Committing material to a Universal Repository is a craft ritual that destroys
        the original text. All materials are preserved in their original languages,
        though one can request them in a different form (e.g. tablet rather than
        scroll). There is no way to remove material from a repository. If a text is
        conjured, updated, and then re-committed, the original version is still
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The various repositories do not naturally interrelate with one another. For
        instance, a book that is committed to the Lettered Smoke cannot be accessed
        from the Invisible Press or the Whispers of the Dead. However, many people
        have created methods by which knowledge is brought out from one repository and
        committed to another, so knowledge that is committed to one Repository will
        eventually be found in the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are currently no restrictions on who can access what knowledge. To keep
        secrets within a repository, one must use codes and ciphers.
      </p>

      <aside title="Repositories and the Blind">
        <h4 id="repo_blind">Repositories and the Blind</h4>
        <p>
          Requesting materials from the Repositories in different forms can be very
          helpful for blind or partially sighted characters. They can effectively
          access materials in the Repositories via touch, feeling what the text would
          be if it were engraved on a clay tablet or cut into stone.At the moment,
          no culture in the Basin has yet created a way to store audio in physical
          (rather than magical) form. Once they do, the Repositories will gladly
          accept them.

        Warding keeps places and people safe. It blocks out hazards while allowing
        safe materials and influences to pass.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To keep someone’s dreams safe, or make a quiet room, ward with Communion.
        </li>
        <li>To keep a building intact or prevent accidents, use Industry.</li>
        <li>To make someone or something difficult to find, use Mystery.</li>

        </li>
        <li>To warn of poison or betrayal, use Trickery.</li>
        <li>To turn blades and deflect Energy Waves, use War.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The larger an area you want to ward, the more time you’ll need to spend on it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Craft ritual:</strong> A small group or a room.</li>
        <li><strong>Minor ritual:</strong> A large group or a house.</li>

        <li><strong>Great Work:</strong> Infrastructure I</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Whether made of runes, faith, or music, wards last until they are disturbed or
        disrupted by something outside their purview. Many people in the Basin have
        wards tattooed on their skin or inscribed on their souls, which are
        effectively permanent.
      </p>
      <p>
        No ward is absolute. A building warded against collapse with Industry can be
        overcome by someone with high enough War, and one trickster might overcome
        another’s protection. Warding is a tool within conflicts, not a way to avoid
        them. Ward-related Complications generally inflict pain or cost time.

      <p>
        One of the more common uses of Industry is in growing crops and speeding
        travel, and weather-working aids both of these. It can also provide a sunny
        day or a torrential flood.
      </p>
      <p>
        More severe shifts in the weather require a greater amount of flow, while
        affecting larger areas requires deeper attunement to the Industry-nature. All
        weather-working is a Craft <a href="Rules.xhtml#rituals">Ritual</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each measure of flow starting with small (that is, small, moderate, large and
        tremendous) allows one to shift the weather one category on the following
        chart.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mild weather. Partly cloudy days, drizzle, pleasant winds.</li>
        <li>Notable weather. Hot sun, rain, snow, fog, severe winds. Or: uncommon
          events like rainbows and microbursts.</li>
        <li>Severe weather. Record heat, torrential downpours, blizzards, winds that
          down trees. Or: rare events like golfball-sized hail or avalanches.</li>
        <li>Extreme weather. Parching dryness, flash floods, whiteouts, tornadoes and
          hurricanes. Or: bizarre events like rains of frogs or fish, technicolor
          floods, or fire tornadoes.</li>
        <li>Impossible extremes. Immediate sunburns, explosions of ice and water,
          winds that cut stone. Or: cubical tornadoes, reverse rain, cherry-petal snow,
          and other absurd weather-like events.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Shifting the weather within a category might be just a comparatively small
        adjustment (e.g. adding lightning to a tornado), or might require moving it
        through “mild” first (e.g. from record heat to torrential downpour).
      </p>
      <p>
        Higher levels of industry allow one to affect larger areas. Industry 2 affects
        the area of a neighborhood; Industry 3, a town; Industry 4, a city; Industry
        5, nearby city-states. Larger-scale weather control is a fairly common piece
        of industrial artistry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blasting someone with weather-working is difficult. It’s simply not an art
        designed for pinpoint accuracy. The techniques that create

      In this section we’ll talk about how to handle invention. We’ll look at both

      <p>
        One thing magic generally doesn’t do is grant game-mechanical bonuses. There
        is no art or ritual whose purpose is to give someone, for example, +1 to a
        Nature. If you’re building one of those, what you really want to do is just
        increase your Nature score, which Becoming will handle for you just fine
        (eventually). Make the change and recalculate your Power and Import if
        needed. The closest you can do is create something that applies an
        effective Nature score. See the

      For the purposes of game mechanics, inventing a new magical art is a Ritual.
      If it’s an entirely new technique with no close parallels in the existing set
      of Expressions, count it as a Major Ritual. If it’s a variation of an existing
      technique, or if you’re pulling a technique from one Fount or Tradition into
      another, count it as a Minor Ritual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minimum Nature level of the art being developed is the Nature score
      required for the development ritual. The profession required can be either
      Scholar, or the profession that would be used to deploy it. For instance,
      creating a variant on Conjuration that allows people to add their own artistic
      tweaks to a conjured object could be done using Artist. The minimum level of
      the profession should always be 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magical tools are designed in a similar manner, but replacing Scholar with
      Theurge for its more practical approach. Most artifacts use an existing art as
      their base – see the <a href="Rules.xhtml#ritx">Ritual section</a> for many examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design process for spells and items is inherently tricky. No one gets a
      new spell completely right the first time. Your flying carpet is likely to be
      a rough ride the first time. There will be kinks to iron out and side effects
      to minimize. Treat this just like any other ritual in terms of
      <a href="Rules.xhtml#prototypes">making the product more reliable</a>.

        One of the reasons the Archive’s work is so valuable to the Basin is that
        they’re effectively uncovering how-to manuals for spells that were created
        and lost long ago. If you can read the language in which the spell is
        written and understand the culture in which it was created, you move the
        process of spell invention from a Major ritual to a Minor one. That shaves
        orders of magnitude off the amount of time it takes to implement a new
        spell.

    <h3 id="Adjudicating New Arts">Adjudicating New Arts</h3>

    <p>In general, sorcerous arts do one of three things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They let you do something that is outside the normal realm of human ability.
        Weather control, telekinesis, curses, and deconjuration are all good
        examples of things that are clearly magical.
      </li>
      <li>
        They let you do a normal human thing, or apply your Nature, in a situation
        where that would otherwise be impossible. Hypnopraxis allows you to act
        while you’re asleep. Farspeech lets you talk to people who aren’t in range
        of your voice. Immortality allows you to heal and think while you’d
        otherwise be dead.
      </li>
      <li>
        They let you change game statistics quickly, or give you access to powerful
        pieces of game mechanics. Transcendence, expanded expertise, and enchantment
        all fit into this area.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You don’t need to feel constrained to these options; they’re just a set of
      categories to consider. If you find yourself falling into more than one
      category, you’ve probably created something too powerful for a single Art. If
      your art only does a little bit of one of these, it might not be broadly
      powerful enough to be worth a Core Expression slot, and you might want to
      consider expanding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the following guidelines to select a Nature score for your new art. This
      is partly a reprint from the rituals section, but the examples here are more
      geared toward quick-cast spells.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature 2</strong> covers basic mystical expressions of otherwise baseline human
        abilities. Actions taken with Nature 2 may be clearly magical, and may even
        have world-changing implications, but it doesn’t do things that sheer
        ingenuity wouldn’t provide in the right circumstances. Examples: the Shroud
        is an extension of ordinary stealth. The arts of Terror are merely
        intimidation turned up to 11. Distillation mimics the arts of a metallurgist
        or chemist, and using Weaponry to create a burning sword is not so different
        from applying poison to one’s blade.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature 3</strong> is where things become impossible to understand or implement as
        anything but magic. These spells cross boundaries, reaching between worlds,
        into dreams, or from emotional to physical. They transform minds and bodies,
        and quickly. Nature 2 will let you see things that are purely magical, but
        you need Nature 3 to actually touch them. Examples: the Shell Game, Travel,
        Spirit-walking, and Mnemosurgery are all good examples of Nature 3 spells.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature 4</strong> acts upon the things from earlier levels. It’s a very “meta” level.
        Sometimes it broadens your power, as with the improvements to shapeshifting.
        Other times it makes things from Nature 2 or 3 more convenient, such as when
        Trickery 4 gives you your own piece of Red Space. Still other times, it adds
        powerful and focused techniques, such as upgrading dream travel into
        Nightmare Exile.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature 5</strong> gets big, fast, and serious. People from nonmagical cultures will
        probably be terrified by these things, even if they’re not from the
        War-nature. Communion forms strong emotional bonds in an instant; Industry
        calls up a mansion from nothing; Trickery traps someone in a hallucination;
        a mastery of Mystery disappears from sight and memory. The fact that people
        can do these things has profound implications for the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beyond the current scale there are theoretical <strong>Nature 6</strong> arts. These are
        not the same as Infrastructure-level magic:
        though they might be of comparable scale, they’re more personal. Individuals
        with Self 6 might let their shapeshifting handle cataclysmic forces while
        maintaining their mind in a state of calm. Communion 6 might connect one’s
        memory directly to a Universal Repository. Those with Industry 6 might raise
        a small city in their own creative idiom. A soldier with War 6 overrides the
        local flow with their own chosen aspects. Arts at Mystery 6 or Trickery 6
        reach into their caster’s own past and future. If you’re hoping to create
        arts for your character at Nature 6, reach for the things that matter to
        them most and express who they are.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="gm_invention">Invention for GMs</h3>

    <p>Good inventions never go away. That’s both a gift and a curse.</p>
    <p>
      It’s a gift to you as the GM because you now have a new plot seed to play
      around with. The players want to invent something? Use the Ritual rules and
      let them run with it. Then leave it in the game. Don’t let it disappear.
      They’ve uncorked the bottle and let out the genie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s a curse because it’s going to change your campaign. Good inventions
      change the world. Civilizations will change the way they do things simply
      because one thing is more convenient than another. Heck, civilizations will
      rise and fall on the back of magical advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to introduce a new magical art to your game, spend some time
      thinking about how society would use this art. How does it express its Nature?
      What emotional state does one need to be in to use it? What would you do with
      this device? What would your average party of RPG characters do with it? What
      would world leaders do with it, or humanitarians, or terrorists, or developing
      nations? The social ramifications of your inventions are far more important
      than how the invention is accomplished, and in the end, they’re more
      interesting too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Introducing new Paths and Founts is somewhat simper, as it probably doesn’t
      change the world that much. It just adds a bit of flavor. You can use those to
      hint at some underlying connection between your NPCs, or to give players a
      slight advantage (or disadvantage) while the new mystical techniques are still
      unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way you as a GM will run into player inventions is when they discover
      an unanticipated use for an existing art. Let them do this. You don’t need to
      insert some sort of hitherto-unknown barrier that keeps them from
      accomplishing something you didn’t expect. Magic in this world is, at 400
      years old, still somewhat new. The civilizations in this book are ripe for the
      change that will come when people realize the full power of the Gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the <a href="Advice.xhtml#world_in_flux">A World In Flux</a> section in the Advice chapter for more on
      how existing magical arts could change the world if only their full
      implications were explored.

  <section class="subchapter" title="What Magic Can't Do" epub:type="chapter">
    <h2 id="magic_cant_do">What Magic Can't Do</h2>
    <p>
      The following things are impossible to accomplish with magic in this game.
      They’re not difficult; they’re truly impossible to accomplish.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Destroy a soul permanently.</strong></li>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove the Gift.</strong> The Gift is permanent, no matter how the Fellowship of
        Truth might wish otherwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Safe instantaneous teleportation.</strong> Travel is the best possible combination of
        speed, safety, and range. There are many other modes of transit that have
        been developed over the ages, but all have massive issues.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Steal flow</strong>. You can't deprive someone of their magical ability by quickly
        removing all their flow. You can create Null Zones, but only slowly and
        gradually, via Rituals. Flow Parasites are an exception – they can steal
        magic or flow from someone as they consume it, but they can’t live any other
        way. Player character flow parasites (who are capable of rational thought)
        can only take it from willing targets.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Should you decide to change any of these, you will be playing a different
      game. Fast-travel, soul destruction, and magic denial are tactics that
      completely alter the game world. Don’t change this list without a lot of
      careful consideration.
    </p>

    <h3>Not Impossible, Just Underdeveloped</h3>

    <p>
      Some things just haven’t been done yet. All of these are magical tactics and
      techniques that could potentially come into being, but which no one has
      actually
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Microscopic vision.</strong> There just aren't a lot of good magical methods for
        this. The closest equivalent is shrinking yourself down with Self and
        viewing things from a small scale. Whether there are microbes, animalcules,
        atoms, quantum loops, and so forth is something you’ll have to decide if you
        want to explore this technique.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Magic in the Basin can cure disease, but it can’t detect it very
        effectively. Psychometry might tell you if someone left a diseased object
        with the intent of causing harm, but it won't tell you what the disease is
        or how to treat it non-magically.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plutomancy.</strong> The Archive has indications from ancient documents that magic
        was once able to control the flow of commerce and resources in a broad
        fashion, directing profits to or away from a particular group. This is no
        longer possible, and experimentation has shown that the Travel lattice
        itself may be responsible for disrupting the methods once used for this, but
        it may be possible to redevelop them without destroying the Travel lattice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>E-mail.</strong> You can use farspeech to connect with someone at a distance, but you
        can't leave them a message. You can burn knowledge into a universal
        repository, but anyone might access it, so you'll need to encrypt secret
        messages. The closest you can get is “hanging” a dream with Oneiromancy or
        having an intermediary send the message for you – and they'll need a mystic
        connection with the recipient.
      </li>

      <a href="Advice.xhtml#ticking_time_bombs">what you can do with existing Expressions</a>
      that hasn’t been explored yet.
