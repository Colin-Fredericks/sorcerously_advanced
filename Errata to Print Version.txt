Errata for the print version of Sorcerously Advanced
Date: 05 April 2021

Errata with major game effects:
* None at this time.

Errata with minor game effects:
* Page 46: In the second bullet point, the sample character should have Power 6 / Import 6
* Page 158: The Rage should refer to the "Hold To Your Traditions" CV.

Errata that doesn't affect game content:
* Page 14: There's a layout gaffe in the top left-hand corner.
* Page 112: There is an extra period after Inheritable that shouldn't be there.

All of this has been fixed in the PDF, epub, and mobi versions. Because updating the physical books is a much more tedious and lengthy process than updating the PDF, the printed versions of Sorcerously Advanced will always be behind the PDF copies. We apologize for the inconvenience.

If you find additional errata, please report it at the game's official support site,
